## Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports: A Detailed Research Report

**Executive Order 14201**, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025. This executive order establishes a federal policy aimed at prohibiting the participation of transgender women and girls in female sports across all educational levels in the United States.

### Purpose and Policy

The stated purpose of Executive Order 14201 is to "protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports". The order asserts that allowing individuals assigned male at birth to compete in women's sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls" and undermines their equal opportunity to participate and excel.

Key policy declarations include:
*   The United States will rescind federal funds from educational programs that are deemed to "deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities".
*   The policy of the United States is to broadly oppose "male competitive participation in women's sports" on the grounds of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.
*   The order mandates that Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs, be interpreted to prohibit the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Educational institutions that do not comply risk losing federal funding.

### Key Provisions and Directives

Executive Order 14201 outlines specific directives for federal agencies:
*   **Secretary of Education's Role**: The Secretary of Education is directed to take "all appropriate action" to "protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms". This includes prioritizing Title IX enforcement actions against institutions that deny female students equal athletic opportunities by requiring them to compete with or against, or appear unclothed before, males in the women's category. The order clarifies that women's sports are to be reserved exclusively for women.
*   **Federal Funding**: All executive departments and agencies are instructed to review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, "rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy" established in the order. Federal funds are also explicitly prohibited from being used to promote "gender ideology".
*   **Definitions**: The order incorporates definitions from Executive Order 14168, issued on January 20, 2025, titled "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government". Executive Order 14168 defines "sex" as an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female. Agency forms requiring an individual's sex must list "male" or "female" and "shall not request gender identity".
*   **International Engagement**: The order also directs actions to promote standards consistent with its policy at the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee. It can also affect U.S. visa policies for athletes traveling to the country for sporting events.
*   **Legal Guidance**: The Attorney General is tasked with issuing immediate guidance to agencies to correct what the order describes as the "misapplication" of the Supreme Court's decision in *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020) to sex-based distinctions in agency activities, and to assist agencies in protecting sex-based distinctions.

### Context and Background

This executive order was signed amidst ongoing national discussions and legal challenges regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports. Prior to this order, some states, such as Idaho (with the Fairness in Women's Sports Act enacted in 2020) and West Virginia (with the Save Women's Sports Act enacted in 2021), had already implemented laws banning transgender women and girls from participating in women's and girls' sports teams at various educational levels.

The Trump administration's stance, articulated in conjunction with this order, is that individuals assigned male at birth possess physical advantages that create unfair competition and safety risks for female athletes, thereby constituting a violation of Title IX. The order followed a January 2025 decision by a Kentucky District Court that vacated the Biden administration's Title IX Final Rule, which had codified protections for transgender students.

Following the issuance of Executive Order 14201, the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) revised its participation policy for transgender student-athletes. The updated NCAA policy now limits competition in women's sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only, allowing those assigned male at birth to practice with women's teams but not compete. The NCAA cited President Trump's executive order as providing a "clear, national standard".

### Legal Challenges

Executive Order 14201, along with Executive Order 14168, has faced legal challenges. In February 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that these executive orders discriminate against transgender individuals in violation of the Fifth Amendment's equal protection rights and Title IX. These plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the executive order is unconstitutional and unlawful, as well as a permanent injunction and nominal damages. The Department of Education has initiated reviews of athletic policies at universities and athletic associations that support the participation of transgender women and girls in female sports for potential Title IX violations. As of January 2026, the Trump administration has opened 18 new investigations into school systems and colleges, including New York City's school system, over their policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports, with the potential loss of federal funding for non-compliant institutions.
