**Research Report: Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports**

**Date of Report:** January 19, 2026

### **Overview**
Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports," was signed by President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025 [1.2, 1.3]. The order is part of a broader federal initiative aimed at establishing a national standard for athletic participation based on biological sex at birth, effectively prohibiting transgender women and girls from competing in female sports categories at all educational levels [1.4, 1.5].

### **Key Provisions**
The executive order introduces several mandates designed to enforce sex-segregated athletics:

*   **Federal Funding Rescission:** The order establishes a federal policy to rescind funding from educational programs and institutions that allow transgender women to compete in women’s sports [1.2, 1.6].
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** It directs the Secretary of Education to prioritize enforcement actions under Title IX against institutions that require female students to compete against biological males or to share intimate spaces, such as locker rooms, with them [1.2, 1.8].
*   **Visa and Entry Restrictions:** Section 4(c) instructs the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to adjust policies to prevent the entry of transgender athletes into the U.S. for the purpose of competing in women’s sports [1.7]. Visa applications for these individuals may be marked with the code 'SWS25' for tracking purposes [1.1].
*   **Adoption of Biological Definitions:** The order relies on definitions established in Executive Order 14168 ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"), which defines "sex," "male," and "female" based on reproductive biology and genetics at birth or conception [1.2, 1.4, 1.10].

### **Implementation and Institutional Impact**
The issuance of EO 14201 prompted immediate changes across national and local athletic organizations:

*   **NCAA Compliance:** Following the order, the NCAA revised its participation policy on February 6, 2025, to limit women’s sports competitions to athletes assigned female at birth [1.1, 1.5].
*   **Department of Education Investigations:** The Department of Education quickly initiated investigations into universities, such as San Jose State University, for possible Title IX violations related to their previous transgender-inclusive policies [1.4, 1.5].
*   **State and Local Resistance:** In response, some municipalities, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, declared themselves "transgender sanctuary cities," committing to refuse cooperation with the federal mandates [1.5].

### **Legal Challenges**
The executive order has faced significant legal opposition:

*   **Constitutional Litigation:** On February 12, 2025, a lawsuit was filed in New Hampshire by transgender student-athletes (e.g., *Orr v. Trump*), alleging that EO 14201 violates the Constitution and Title IX by discriminating on the basis of gender identity [1.5, 1.10].
*   **Supreme Court Involvement:** The order’s implementation coincided with landmark Supreme Court debates, such as *West Virginia v. B.P.J.*, which examined whether states have the authority to maintain sex-separated sports programs [1.18, 1.19].

### **Philosophical and Policy Justification**
The White House argues that the order is necessary to "restore biological truth" and protect the "safety, fairness, and dignity" of female athletes [1.3]. Proponents assert that allowing biological males in women's categories devalues the achievements of female athletes and violates the original intent of Title IX [1.1, 1.3]. Conversely, critics argue the order targets a vulnerable population and ignores legal precedents, such as *Bostock v. Clayton County*, which recognized gender identity under sex discrimination protections [1.5, 1.10].
