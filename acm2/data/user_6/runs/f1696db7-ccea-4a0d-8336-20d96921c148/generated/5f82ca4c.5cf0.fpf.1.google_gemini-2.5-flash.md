## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports

**Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025.** This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women and girls from competing in female sports across all educational levels, from elementary to post-secondary institutions.

**Key Provisions and Purpose:**

The executive order establishes a policy for the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports, citing reasons of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth. It asserts that allowing men to compete in women's sports is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies them equal opportunities in athletics.

Central to EO 14201 is its reliance on a strict biological interpretation of "sex," which refers back to definitions established in Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government". This interpretation defines "sex" as biologically distinct, applying to terms like "male," "female," "men," "women," "boys," and "girls" in federal agency business, documents, and communications. The order mandates that government-issued identification documents and personnel records should accurately reflect the holder's sex as defined by this biological interpretation.

**Impact on Federal Funding and Education:**

Executive Order 14201 threatens to revoke federal funding from any educational institution (elementary, secondary, or post-secondary) that permits transgender girls and women to play on girls' and women's sports teams, considering such actions a violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. The order directs the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Attorney General, to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against institutions and athletic associations that deny female students equal opportunities by requiring them to compete with or against males in women's sports categories.

Furthermore, the order prohibits federal funds from being used to promote "gender ideology" and instructs agencies to review grant conditions and preferences to ensure compliance. Agencies are also required to remove statements, policies, regulations, forms, and communications that promote or inculcate gender ideology, and forms requiring an individual's sex must list "male" or "female" without requesting gender identity.

**Related Actions and Challenges:**

Following the issuance of Executive Order 14201, the NCAA updated its participation policy for transgender student-athletes on February 6, 2025. The new NCAA policy limits competition in women's sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth, citing President Trump's order as providing a clear national standard. While the policy allows student-athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women's teams and receive benefits, it restricts their competition.

The Trump administration has initiated investigations into school systems and colleges that allow transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports, warning that these institutions risk losing federal funding. The administration's stance is that athletes assigned male at birth possess physical advantages, leading to unfair competition and safety risks for other athletes in girls' and women's sports.

In response to Executive Orders 14168 and 14201, at least one legal challenge has emerged. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that these executive orders discriminate against transgender individuals in violation of the Constitution and Title IX.
