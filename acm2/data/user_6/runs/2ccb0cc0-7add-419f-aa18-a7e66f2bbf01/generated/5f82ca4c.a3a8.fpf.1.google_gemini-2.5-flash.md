## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports

**Washington D.C.**—On February 5, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order 14201, officially titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," with the stated purpose of protecting opportunities for women and girls in athletics. This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports at all educational levels, from elementary school through college.

The executive order builds upon definitions established in a prior directive, Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," issued on January 20, 2025. Executive Order 14168 defines "sex" as an individual's "immutable biological classification as either male or female," and explicitly states that "sex is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of 'gender identity'". Executive Order 14201 applies these definitions to athletic eligibility, emphasizing biological sex assigned at birth as the determining factor.

### Key Provisions and Directives:

Executive Order 14201 outlines several key policies and directives:

*   **Federal Funding Withdrawal:** The order mandates the rescinding of federal funds from educational programs that permit transgender female athletes to participate in female sports. This is based on the administration's interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, asserting that allowing "men to compete in women's sports" is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" for female athletes and denies them equal opportunity.
*   **Department of Education Actions:** The Secretary of Education is directed to take appropriate actions to protect all-female athletic opportunities and locker rooms. This includes prioritizing Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions and athletic associations that require female students to compete with or against males in women's categories or appear unclothed before males. The order also directs the Department of Education not to enforce certain 2024 regulations that expanded Title IX protections to include gender identity.
*   **International Sports and Immigration:** The Executive Order instructs the Secretary of State to advocate for changes within the International Olympic Committee to amend standards governing Olympic sporting events, ensuring eligibility for women's events is determined by sex, not gender identity or testosterone reduction. Additionally, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security are directed to review and adjust visa policies to prevent males from entering the United States if they falsely assert female identity to compete in women's sports.
*   **Inter-Agency Coordination:** The Department of Justice is tasked with providing necessary resources for the expeditious enforcement of the order's policy. State Attorneys General are to be convened to identify best practices for defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women in sports and to hear stories of women harmed by male participation in women's sports.

### Context and Related Developments:

This executive order is part of a broader initiative by the Trump administration to limit the rights of transgender individuals, including orders related to military service and passport applications. President Trump had campaigned on banning what he referred to as "men" from competing in women's sports.

Following the executive order, the Department of Education urged high school and college athletics organizations, such as the NCAA and NFHS, to revoke female transgender athletes' records and restore cisgender athletes' records. The NCAA subsequently revised its participation policy for transgender student-athletes, limiting competition in women's sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth.

In January 2025, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" of 2025, which seeks to amend Title IX to define sex based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth, thereby restricting transgender students from playing on women's sports teams. However, Senate Democrats blocked an attempt to codify this ban.

### Legal Challenges:

Executive Order 14201, along with Executive Order 14168, has faced legal challenges. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging discrimination against transgender individuals in violation of the Constitution and Title IX.

The broader issue of transgender athletes' participation in sports is also being addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court. On January 13, 2026, the Supreme Court heard arguments in appeals from Idaho and West Virginia regarding state laws banning transgender athletes from female sports teams. These cases, *Little v. Hecox* (Idaho) and *West Virginia v. B.P.J.*, center on whether such bans violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title IX. Lower court rulings had temporarily blocked these state bans. Conservative justices on the Supreme Court have appeared inclined to uphold state bans on transgender athletes from female sports. The outcome of these cases is expected to have significant implications for transgender rights nationwide.
