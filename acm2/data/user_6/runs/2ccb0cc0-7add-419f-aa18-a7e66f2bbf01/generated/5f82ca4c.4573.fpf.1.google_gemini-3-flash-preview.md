Executive Order 14201, titled "**Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports**," was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025 [1][10]. The order establishes a federal policy to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports at all educational levels, primarily by leveraging Title IX enforcement and federal funding [1][3].

### **Key Provisions and Policy Objectives**
The executive order outlines several core directives aimed at restricting participation in women's sports based on biological sex:
*   **Rescission of Federal Funds:** It is the official policy of the United States to rescind federal funding from any educational institution or program that allows biological males to compete in women’s sports, citing such participation as "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" [1][3].
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is directed to prioritize enforcement actions against schools that permit transgender females to compete on women’s teams or access women-only spaces, such as locker rooms [1][13].
*   **Biological Definitions:** The order adopts definitions from Executive Order 14168 (signed January 20, 2025), which defines "male" and "female" as immutable biological classifications determined at birth [1][4].
*   **International Advocacy:** The Secretary of State is instructed to promote sex-based female sports categories internationally, including at the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee [1][5].
*   **Regulatory Vacatur:** The order requires the Department of Education to ensure that 2024 regulations expanding Title IX protections to include gender identity remain without effect [3][6].

### **Immediate Impact and Organizational Response**
The issuance of EO 14201 prompted rapid policy changes across major athletic organizations:
*   **NCAA Policy Shift:** On February 6, 2025, one day after the order was signed, the NCAA updated its transgender participation policy. The new rules limit competition in women’s sports exclusively to athletes assigned female at birth [2][7]. Transgender women may still practice with teams and receive benefits but are barred from official competition [8][13].
*   **State Department Restrictions:** On February 25, 2025, the State Department announced a ban on transgender athletes entering the U.S. to compete in women's sports. Visa applicants suspected of such intent are tracked with the code "SWS25" [2].
*   **Department of Education Audits:** The Department immediately began reviewing the policies of universities and athletic associations to identify potential Title IX violations related to gender identity inclusion [5].

### **Legal Challenges and Resistance**
The order has faced significant legal and political opposition:
*   **Lawsuits:** On February 12, 2025, transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that EO 14201 violates the Constitution and Title IX by discriminating on the basis of gender identity [5].
*   **Sanctuary Cities:** Some municipalities, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, declared themselves "transgender sanctuary cities" in February 2025, refusing to cooperate with federal entities enforcing the order [5].
*   **State Conflict:** In states like California, the executive order directly conflicts with state laws (e.g., Education Code section 221.5(f)) that guarantee students the right to participate in activities consistent with their gender identity [4].
