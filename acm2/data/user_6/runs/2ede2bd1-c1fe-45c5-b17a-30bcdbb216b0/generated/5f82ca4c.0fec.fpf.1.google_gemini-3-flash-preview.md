This research report provides an analysis of **Executive Order (EO) 14201**, titled "**Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports**," signed by President Donald Trump on **February 5, 2025** [1.1][1.2]. 

### **I. Overview and Purpose**
Executive Order 14201 establishes a federal policy to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports teams across all educational levels, from K-12 to post-secondary institutions [1.1][1.4]. The order characterizes the participation of biological males in women's sports as "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous," asserting that such participation denies female athletes equal opportunities to excel [1.8][1.14].

### **II. Definitions and Legal Framework**
The order relies on the definitions of "sex," "male," and "female" established in **Executive Order 14168** ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"), signed on January 20, 2025 [1.3][1.4]. Under this framework:
*   **Sex** is defined as an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female determined at birth (or conception) [1.3][1.4].
*   **Gender identity** is explicitly excluded from the definition of "sex" for the purposes of federal law and Title IX enforcement [1.4][1.9].

### **III. Key Provisions**
Executive Order 14201 mandates several aggressive enforcement mechanisms:
*   **Funding Rescission:** The federal government will review and rescind federal grants and funding from any educational institution or program that permits transgender women or girls to compete on female teams [1.3][1.6].
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is directed to prioritize enforcement actions against institutions that require female students to compete against males or to "appear unclothed before males" in locker rooms [1.3][1.8].
*   **Athletic Records:** The Department of Education has been urged to work with collegiate and high school athletic organizations (like the NCAA and NFHS) to revoke records held by transgender female athletes and restore them to cisgender athletes [1.2].
*   **International Advocacy:** The Secretary of State is tasked with promoting these standards at the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ensure international sports are divided by biological sex [1.1][1.5].
*   **Travel Restrictions:** The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security are directed to review policies to prevent transgender women from entering the United States to participate in women’s sports [1.5].

### **IV. Impact and Reactions**
*   **NCAA Response:** Following the order, the NCAA revised its participation policy on February 6, 2025, to limit women’s college competitions to athletes assigned female at birth, effective immediately [1.2][1.4].
*   **State Conflict:** California and other states with laws protecting transgender athletes have indicated they will continue to follow state-level protections, leading to potential preemption legal battles [1.3][1.10].
*   **Legal Challenges:** Several lawsuits have emerged. On February 12, 2025, a lawsuit was filed in New Hampshire (*Tirrell v. Edelblut*) alleging the order violates the Constitution and Title IX by discriminating based on gender identity [1.1][1.7].
*   **Judicial Review:** The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in early 2026 regarding state-level bans (*West Virginia v. B.P.J.*), a case seen as a critical test for the federal policies established by EO 14201 [1.12][1.13].
