## Executive Order 14201: "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"

**Washington, D.C.** – On February 5, 2025, former President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14201, officially titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports." This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports across all educational levels, from elementary schools through collegiate athletics, based on a strict interpretation of biological sex. The administration asserts that this measure is necessary to safeguard fairness, safety, and equal opportunities for cisgender women and girls in competitive sports.

### Policy and Purpose

Executive Order 14201 is rooted in the administration's stance that allowing individuals assigned male at birth to compete in women's sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" to cisgender female athletes. The order leverages definitions from a prior directive, Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," which defines "sex" as an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female at birth. The order explicitly states that "sex" is not synonymous with "gender identity".

The core policy of the order is to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.

### Key Provisions and Directives

Executive Order 14201 outlines several mandates to achieve its objectives:
*   **Federal Funding Withdrawal:** The order directs the federal government to rescind all funds from educational programs that permit transgender women and girls to participate in female sports. This action is based on the claim that such participation deprives cisgender women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, potentially violating Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.
*   **Title IX Interpretation and Enforcement:** The Department of Education is instructed to interpret Title IX as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Furthermore, the Secretary of Education is tasked with prioritizing Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions, including athletic associations, that do not comply with this policy.
*   **Athletic Records:** Following the executive order, the Department of Education urged high school and college athletics organizations, such as the NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), to revoke the records of female transgender athletes and reinstate those of cisgender athletes.
*   **International Advocacy:** The order directs the Secretary of State to utilize all appropriate measures to encourage the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee to amend their standards for Olympic sporting events. The goal is to ensure that eligibility for women's sporting events is determined by sex assigned at birth, rather than gender identity or testosterone levels.
*   **Travel Restrictions:** On February 25, 2025, the State Department announced a ban on transgender athletes from entering the United States if their intent is to compete in women's sports. Visa applicants suspected of this will have their files marked with 'SWS25'. Additionally, any visa applicant who lists a gender other than their sex assigned at birth on their application could face a permanent ban from entering the U.S. on grounds of "fraud".

### Reactions and Impact

The executive order has elicited significant reactions and triggered several consequential developments:
*   **NCAA Compliance:** The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) responded by changing its policy to comply with the executive order. The revised policy limits competition in women's sports to student-athletes who were assigned female at birth, effective immediately. NCAA President Charlie Baker praised the order for providing a "clear, national standard".
*   **Legal Challenges:** The executive order has already faced legal challenges. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 are discriminatory and violate the U.S. Constitution and Title IX.
*   **Supreme Court Cases:** The U.S. Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments in two landmark cases, *Little v. Hecox* (Idaho) and *West Virginia v. B.P.J.*, which challenge similar state laws banning transgender athletes from women's sports. Oral arguments for these cases were heard on January 13, 2026, and they question whether such laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title IX.
*   **Broader Anti-Trans Agenda:** Executive Order 14201 is part of a broader series of actions by the Trump administration targeting transgender rights, which also include restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors and aiming to bar openly transgender service members from the military.
*   **Advocacy Group Responses:** Advocacy groups, such as the Interfaith Alliance, have expressed deep concern over the executive order, viewing it as a "dangerous step backward" that undermines the dignity and rights of LGBTQ+ individuals.

The implementation and ongoing legal challenges surrounding Executive Order 14201 are expected to have significant implications for transgender athletes and the future of sports policy in the United States.
