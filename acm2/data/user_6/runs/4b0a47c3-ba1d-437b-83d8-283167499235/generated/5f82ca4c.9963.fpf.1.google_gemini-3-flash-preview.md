# Research Report: Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports

Executive Order 14201 was signed by President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025 [1][2]. The order establishes a federal policy aimed at prohibiting the participation of transgender women and girls in athletic categories designated for women and girls across all educational levels [3][4]. It characterizes such participation as "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" and positions the order as a measure to protect the safety, dignity, and equal opportunity of biological females under Title IX [1][4].

### Policy and Purpose
The stated purpose of Executive Order 14201 is to ensure that women and girls have "safe and fair" opportunities to compete in sports [1]. The administration argues that allowing biological males to compete in female sports categories denies women equal access to educational benefits and athletic success [1][5]. 

The order cites recent federal court decisions, such as *Tennessee v. Cardona* and *Kansas v. U.S. Dept. of Education*, to support its stance that "ignoring fundamental biological truths" deprives women of meaningful access to facilities [1][4]. Consequently, the federal government's policy is now to:
*   Oppose male participation in female sports as a matter of "safety, fairness, dignity, and truth" [1].
*   Rescind federal funding from educational programs that fail to exclude transgender women from female sports [3][5].

### Key Provisions
The order mandates several specific actions by executive departments and agencies:

*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is directed to prioritize enforcement actions against educational institutions—including athletic associations—that require female students to compete against males or share locker rooms with them [1][4][5].
*   **Funding Rescission:** All federal agencies are required to review their grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding from any program that allows transgender women to participate in women's sports [1][3].
*   **Compliance with Regulations:** The Secretary of Education must ensure compliance with the nationwide vacatur of 2024 Title IX regulations that had previously expanded protections to include gender identity [3][4].
*   **Facilities Protection:** Agencies are instructed to take "all appropriate action" to affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms [4][5].
*   **International and State Coordination:** The Attorney General is tasked with convening State Attorneys General to identify best practices for enforcing these standards [1][3]. Furthermore, the administration seeks to promote these standards to international bodies, including the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee [3].

### Regulatory Definitions
Executive Order 14201 explicitly adopts the definitions established in **Executive Order 14168**, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," signed on January 20, 2025 [1][4]. Under these definitions, "sex" is defined as an "immutable biological classification" based on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth [2][5]. This definition serves as the foundation for determining eligibility for sports categories under the new policy [2][3].

### Immediate Impacts and Reactions
The issuance of the order led to immediate changes in the collegiate and amateur sports landscape:
*   **NCAA Policy Change:** Shortly after the order was signed, the NCAA revised its participation policy to limit women's college sports competitions to athletes who were assigned female at birth [2][3]. NCAA President Charlie Baker noted that the order provided a "clear, national standard" for the organization [2].
*   **Department of Education Action:** The Department of Education quickly began reviewing the athletics policies of universities for possible Title IX violations under the new directive [3].
*   **Visa Bans:** On February 25, 2025, the State Department announced a ban on transgender athletes entering the U.S. if they intended to compete in women's sports [2].

### Legal Challenges
The order has faced significant legal opposition:
*   **New Hampshire Lawsuit:** On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students filed a lawsuit (*Tirrell v. Trump*) claiming the order violates the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection clause and conflicts with the Supreme Court's precedent in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, which recognized discrimination based on gender identity as a form of sex discrimination [2][3][8].
*   **Constitutional Arguments:** Plaintiffs in various challenges argue the order represents an *ultra vires* action (acting beyond legal authority) and a violation of the separation of powers by withholding funds already appropriated by Congress [8].
*   **Sanctuary Cities:** Some municipalities, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, have declared themselves "transgender sanctuary cities," committing to refuse cooperation with the federal enforcement of this order [3].
