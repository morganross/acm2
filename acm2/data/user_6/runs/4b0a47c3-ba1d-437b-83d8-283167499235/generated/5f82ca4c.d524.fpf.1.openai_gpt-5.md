Executive summary
- Executive Order 14201, “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” was signed on February 5, 2025 and published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025 (FR Doc. 2025-02513). [1][2]
- The order declares it U.S. policy to rescind federal funds from educational programs that allow “men” to compete in women’s sports and directs agencies to enforce Title IX consistent with that policy. [1]
- EO 14201 incorporates definitions from Executive Order 14168 (January 20, 2025), which defines sex as binary and immutable for federal policy and directs agencies to apply sex—not gender identity—in enforcing sex-based laws. [1][3]
- The order references—and directs compliance with—a January 9, 2025 federal court decision vacating the Biden Administration’s 2024 Title IX rule (Tennessee v. Cardona), positioning EO 14201 within a broader reset of federal Title IX enforcement. [1][4][5]
- Following EO 14201, multiple agencies initiated enforcement and policy actions, including HHS OCR (investigations), the U.S. Department of Education (warning letters, referrals and funding-termination proceedings), DOJ (letters, investigations and litigation), and USCIS (visa/petition guidance), while major sports bodies (NCAA, USOPC) aligned policies with the order. [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][17][18][19]
- The Supreme Court heard arguments in January 2026 on state bans affecting transgender athletes, a separate but highly relevant legal context that may shape future Title IX and athletics policy nationwide. [15][16]

What the order does (text and authorities)
- Number, title, and publication: Executive Order 14201—“Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports”—signed February 5, 2025; published February 11, 2025 (FR Doc. 2025-02513). [1][2]
- Policy statement: Declares that allowing men to compete in women’s sports is “demeaning, unfair, and dangerous,” and that educational institutions receiving federal funds must ensure equal athletic opportunity for women under Title IX. [1]
- Title IX enforcement/education provisions:
  - Directs the Secretary of Education, in coordination with DOJ, to comply with the vacatur of the April 29, 2024 Title IX rule and ensure it has no effect. [1]
  - Orders affirmative protection of all‑female athletic opportunities, prioritizing Title IX enforcement against institutions that require female students in women’s categories to “compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males.” [1]
  - Instructs all departments and agencies to review grants to education programs and rescind funding, where appropriate, for noncompliance. [1]
- Non‑education/sports‑governance provisions:
  - Calls for the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy to convene athletic organizations and state attorneys general to promote policies consistent with Title IX as articulated in the order. [1]
  - Directs the Secretary of State to rescind support for programs where female categories are based on identity rather than sex and to promote sex‑based categories internationally, including at the United Nations and International Olympic Committee. [1]
  - Directs the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to review and adjust admission policies to prevent entry of “males seeking to participate in women’s sports,” referencing INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i). [1]
- Incorporation of definitions from EO 14168: EO 14201 adopts EO 14168’s definitions (e.g., “sex,” “male,” “female”) for executive‑branch interpretation and enforcement; EO 14168 directs all agencies to use sex‑based definitions in policy and enforcement and rescinds earlier gender‑identity guidance. [1][3]

Background and legal context
- Vacatur of the 2024 Title IX rule: On January 9, 2025, Chief Judge Danny Reeves (E.D. Ky.) vacated the Biden Administration’s 2024 Title IX regulation nationwide (State of Tennessee v. Cardona), concluding it exceeded statutory authority and violated the APA and other constitutional provisions; EO 14201 instructs Education to comply with that vacatur. [1][4][5]
- Pending Supreme Court review of state bans: On January 13, 2026, the Supreme Court heard arguments on Idaho and West Virginia laws restricting transgender girls’ and women’s participation in female sports; reporting indicated the Court appeared inclined to uphold such bans, which could influence federal enforcement landscapes under Title IX. [15][16]

Agency implementation since EO 14201
- Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR): On February 21, 2025, HHS OCR announced a compliance review of Maine’s Department of Education and University of Maine System for potential Title IX violations, expressly aligning with EO 14201’s policy. [6]
- U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office for Civil Rights:
  - March 31, 2025: Final warning letter to Maine DOE, setting a deadline to resolve findings or face DOJ referral and funding termination proceedings. [7]
  - April 11, 2025: ED referred Maine to DOJ and initiated an administrative proceeding to adjudicate termination of federal K‑12 funding over noncompliance. [8]
  - June 25, 2025: Findings that the California Department of Education (CDE) and California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) violated Title IX by allowing males to compete in girls’ sports. [9]
- Department of Justice (DOJ):
  - February 25, 2025: DOJ sent letters warning California, Maine, and Minnesota to comply with federal law and EO 14201’s policy. [10]
  - May 28, 2025: DOJ announced investigations in California, including a statement of interest in litigation over Title IX compliance. [11]
  - April 4, 2025: DOJ and ED announced a Title IX Special Investigations Team to accelerate and coordinate enforcement. [12]
  - July 9, 2025: DOJ filed suit against California CDE/CIF alleging Title IX violations related to male participation in female sports categories. [13]
- Department of Homeland Security/USCIS: August 4, 2025 press release states USCIS updated Policy Manual guidance in alignment with EO 14201, clarifying eligibility for certain athlete-related visa categories and aiming to prevent visa benefits that could facilitate male participation in women’s sports. [14]

Effects on sports governing bodies
- NCAA policy change: On February 6, 2025, the NCAA announced it would limit women’s competition to athletes assigned female at birth, explicitly aligning with the new federal policy direction; this replaced prior sport‑by‑sport criteria and took immediate effect. [17]
- USOPC policy alignment:
  - The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee updated its public guidance page to direct stakeholders to the Athlete Safety Policy “as of July 21, 2025,” signaling reliance on an updated policy framework. [18]
  - Reporting by NBC News (New York) stated the USOPC updated its Athlete Safety Policy to comply with EO 14201, with leadership citing obligations as a federally chartered organization; the policy language references coordination “to ensure that women have a fair and safe competition environment consistent with Executive Order 14201.” [19]
- International/IOC angle: EO 14201 directs the State Department to promote sex‑based eligibility standards internationally and to seek IOC rule changes accordingly, linking federal diplomacy to sports eligibility issues. [1]

Key implementation mechanisms in EO 14201
- Funding leverage: Agencies must review—and where appropriate rescind—grants to education programs that fail to comply, positioning funding termination as the principal enforcement tool. [1]
- Title IX enforcement priorities: Education and DOJ are to prioritize investigations and enforcement where institutions in women’s categories require females to compete with or appear unclothed before males. [1]
- Interagency coordination: DOJ support, State and DHS border/visa policies, and convenings led by the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy extend enforcement beyond schools to international sport and immigration contexts. [1]

Early compliance and enforcement examples
- Maine: ED issued final warning (March 31, 2025), then referred the matter to DOJ and initiated funding‑termination proceedings (April 11, 2025), following HHS OCR’s announced compliance review. [7][8][6]
- California: ED found violations at CDE/CIF (June 25, 2025), and DOJ opened investigations and later sued in federal court to enforce Title IX. [9][11][13]

Unresolved questions and what to watch
- Supreme Court decisions on state bans: The forthcoming rulings in the Idaho and West Virginia cases could define constitutional and Title IX parameters for sex‑based athletic eligibility, shaping EO 14201’s enforcement environment in schools. [15][16]
- Agency adjudications and litigation outcomes: Funding‑termination proceedings and DOJ lawsuits (e.g., California) will test EO 14201’s interpretation of Title IX and its durability in court. [8][13]
- Governance across sports ecosystems: NCAA and USOPC steps suggest convergence toward sex‑based eligibility; further changes by national governing bodies and international federations may follow, especially under diplomatic pressure contemplated by EO 14201. [17][18][19]

Timeline (selected)
- January 20, 2025: EO 14168 (sex‑based definitions) signed and posted by the White House. [3]
- January 9, 2025: E.D. Ky. vacates the 2024 Title IX rule (Tennessee v. Cardona). [4][5]
- February 5, 2025: EO 14201 signed; Federal Register publication on February 11, 2025 (FR Doc. 2025-02513). [1][2]
- February–July 2025: HHS OCR, Education, DOJ, and USCIS announce enforcement and policy steps aligned to EO 14201. [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]
- February–July 2025: NCAA policy change and USOPC policy alignment reported. [17][18][19]
- January 13, 2026: Supreme Court hears arguments on state transgender‑athlete bans; decisions expected in 2026. [15][16]

Bottom line
- EO 14201 operationalizes a sex‑based interpretation of Title IX by conditioning federal education funds and directing coordinated agency actions—including Education, DOJ, HHS, State, DHS/USCIS—while signaling a federal posture to press sports bodies and international actors toward sex‑based eligibility rules. [1][3]
- Early agency actions (investigations, referrals, funding proceedings, litigation) and policy shifts by NCAA and USOPC indicate rapid implementation, though ultimate contours will depend on courts, including pending Supreme Court decisions that could further define permissible boundaries for sex‑based athletic eligibility.
