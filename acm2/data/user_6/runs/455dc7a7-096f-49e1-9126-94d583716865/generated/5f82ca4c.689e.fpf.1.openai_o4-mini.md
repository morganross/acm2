**Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports: Research Report**

**Introduction**  
Executive Order 14201, titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025, and published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025 [1][2]. The order directs federal agencies to interpret Title IX’s prohibition on sex‐based discrimination to exclude male participation from women’s athletic programs and to rescind federal funding from institutions that allow it [1][2].

**Background and Legal Context**  
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in any education program receiving federal funds. Over recent years, some educational institutions and athletic governing bodies have permitted transgender women—individuals assigned male at birth—to compete in girls’ and women’s sports, often under policies requiring hormone suppression or documentation of gender identity [1]. Federal courts, including the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky in Tennessee v. Cardona (24-cv-00072) and the District of Kansas in Kansas v. U.S. Department of Education (24-cv-04041), have held that “ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities” and emphasize Title IX’s goal of protecting biological women in education [1].

**Key Provisions of the Order**  
1. **Policy Statement (Section 1):** Establishes that male participation in women’s sports is “demeaning, unfair, and dangerous” and contravenes Title IX’s guarantee of equal athletic opportunities for women and girls [1].  
2. **Definitions (Section 2):** Adopts definitions from Executive Order 14168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”) to distinguish “male” and “female” based on biological sex at birth [1].  
3. **Enforcement in Education (Section 3):**  
   - Requires the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Attorney General, to vacate and disable the April 29, 2024, nondiscrimination rule (89 FR 33474) and to align regulations and guidance with a biological definition of women’s sports [1].  
   - Directs all executive departments to review and rescind grants to educational programs that permit male participation in women’s athletic categories [1].  
   - Instructs the Department of Justice to allocate resources for swift enforcement actions against non-complying institutions [1].  
4. **Fairness and Safety in Sports (Section 4):**  
   - Tasks the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy with convening athletic organizations, state attorneys general, and affected female athletes within 60 days to develop “fair and safe” policies consistent with Title IX [1].  
   - Directs the Secretary of State to withdraw support for international programs that use gender identity rather than sex-based categories, promote sex-based female categories at the U.N. and International Olympic Committee, and, jointly with the Secretary of Homeland Security, restrict entry of male athletes seeking to compete in women’s sports under immigration law [1].  
5. **General Provisions (Section 5):** Affirms that the order does not impair existing agency authority, is subject to appropriations, creates no enforceable private rights, and includes a severability clause [1].

**Implementation and Agency Roles**  
- **Department of Education:** Charged with disabling prior nondiscrimination regulations and implementing Title IX enforcement actions against institutions allowing male participation in women’s sports [1].  
- **Department of Justice:** Directed to provide enforcement resources and support other agencies in upholding the order’s policies [1].  
- **Office of Management and Budget:** Retains oversight of budgetary and legislative proposals to effectuate the order [1].  
- **Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy:** To lead stakeholder convenings to develop model policies [1].  
- **Department of State and Department of Homeland Security:** To adjust diplomatic and immigration policies to prevent foreign male athletes from entering to compete in U.S. women’s sports [1].

**Reactions and Impact**  
Major collegiate and high-school athletic bodies moved swiftly. On February 6, 2025, the NCAA announced an immediate policy barring transgender women (those assigned male at birth) from competing in women’s college sports, citing the executive order’s clear national standard amid conflicting state laws [3]. In contrast, the California Interscholastic Federation stated it would continue to follow California law, which permits transgender girls’ participation under state nondiscrimination statutes—setting up potential conflicts between federal funding threats and state compliance [2]. Public opinion polls in early 2025 found substantial majorities supporting restrictions on transgender athletes in women’s sports, reflecting a contentious national debate [2].

**Criticisms and Legal Challenges**  
Civil rights and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups have criticized the order as discriminatory, arguing it violates the rights of transgender students and conflicts with the recent Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) decision extending Title VII protections to gender identity [2]. Several states and private individuals have announced plans to challenge the order’s interpretation of Title IX and its funding withdrawal threats in federal court. Additionally, the order’s extraterritorial directives to restrict foreign athletes’ entry and influence international sports organizations may face international legal and diplomatic resistance.

**Conclusion**  
Executive Order 14201 represents a significant executive-branch intervention in sex-based sports policy, leveraging federal funding and regulatory authority to enforce a biological definition of women’s sports. Its sweeping provisions—affecting educational institutions, domestic and international athletic bodies, and immigration—have already prompted policy changes by major sports organizations and raised complex legal and political disputes over federalism, civil rights, and international norms in sports competition.
