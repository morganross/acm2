Research report: Executive Order 14201—“Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports”

Executive summary
- Executive Order 14201 was signed on February 5, 2025 and published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025 (FR Doc. 2025-02513; pages 9279–9281). It declares a federal policy to protect “a sex-based female sports category,” directs agencies to rescind federal funds from educational programs that allow “males” to compete in women’s sports in violation of Title IX as interpreted by the order, and instructs multiple departments on enforcement and international advocacy. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- The order incorporates definitions from Executive Order 14168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”), which defines sex as immutable and directs federal usage of sex-based terminology; EO 14168 was published January 30, 2025. [4] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/01/30/2025-02090.html?utm_source=openai))
- EO 14201 also instructs the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to review admission policies for athletes and to use fraud/misrepresentation grounds under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) as appropriate, potentially affecting visas for athletes seeking to compete in women’s categories. [1][5] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Primary text and legal mechanics
- Title and issuance: “Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” signed February 5, 2025; published February 11, 2025. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Section 1 (Policy and Purpose): States that allowing men to compete in women’s sports is “demeaning, unfair, and dangerous,” and ties the policy to Title IX obligations; the order cites federal litigation in Tennessee v. Cardona and Kansas v. U.S. Department of Education to support its interpretation. [1] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Section 2 (Definitions): Incorporates definitions from EO 14168, which sets a binary, immutable definition of sex for executive-branch interpretation and implementation. [1][4] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Section 3 (Education enforcement): Directs the Secretary of Education to (i) ensure the Biden 2024 Title IX rule has no effect following its vacatur, (ii) prioritize enforcement actions to “affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities,” and (iii) authorize grant rescissions for noncompliance; DOJ must support expeditious enforcement. [1] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Section 4 (Broader sports and international measures): Directs the Domestic Policy Council to convene athletic bodies; instructs State to withdraw support from exchanges that use identity (not sex) for female categories and to promote sex-based eligibility internationally (including at the UN); directs State and DHS to review/adjust entry policies and reference 8 U.S.C. §1182; directs State to press the IOC for sex-based eligibility rules. [1][5] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- General provisions: Standard clauses that implementation must follow applicable law and that the order creates no judicially enforceable rights. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Context: Title IX rulemaking and courts
- On January 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky vacated the Biden Administration’s April 2024 Title IX final rule nationwide in State of Tennessee v. Cardona; law firm alerts and national outlets documented the nationwide vacatur and its rationale. [17][18][19][20] ([mcguirewoods.com](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2025/1/title-ix-final-rule-vacated-nationwide/?utm_source=openai))
- The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse summarizes related litigation in Kansas v. U.S. Department of Education and later procedural steps after the change in administration. [21] ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/45705/?utm_source=openai))
- As of January 13–14, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in consolidated cases on state bans (Idaho and West Virginia) and reporting indicates the Court appears likely to uphold such laws, with a decision expected by early summer 2026. [15][16] ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/13/supreme-court-transgender-athletes-state-bans/?utm_source=openai))

Federal implementation and enforcement actions following EO 14201
- U.S. Department of Education (ED) statements and investigations:
  - Feb 5, 2025: ED issued a statement supporting EO 14201’s policy and announced prioritization of Title IX enforcement to protect “all-female athletic opportunities.” [6] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports?utm_source=openai))

  - Jan 14, 2026: Washington Post reported ED opened 18 new investigations into K‑12 districts and colleges for permitting transgender participation in girls’ and women’s sports, citing EO 14201’s interpretation of Title IX. [14] ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2026/01/14/trump-administration-trans-athletes-investigations/))
- HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) actions:
  - Feb 21, 2025: HHS OCR announced a compliance review of Maine education entities over policies allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports, citing EO 14201. [11] ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/keeping-men-out-womens-sports.html?utm_source=openai))
  - Mar 17, 2025: HHS OCR issued a determination finding Maine in violation of Title IX for allowing “males in women’s sports,” offering a short window for voluntary resolution before DOJ referral. [12] ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-civil-rights-office-determines-maine-violates-title-ix-allowing-males-womens-sports.html?utm_source=openai))
- USCIS/DHS alignment with EO 14201:
  - Aug 4, 2025: USCIS announced Policy Manual updates aligning athlete‑related visa categories and benefits with EO 14201 to prevent “male aliens” from being authorized to participate in women’s sports. [13] ([uscis.gov](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-updating-policy-to-protect-womens-sports?utm_source=openai))

Sector responses (college, Olympic and national governing bodies)
- NCAA: On Feb 6, 2025, the NCAA Board of Governors adopted a policy restricting participation in women’s sports to athletes “assigned female at birth,” citing the need for national consistency after the EO; this change is documented in the NCAA’s release and AP coverage. [22][23] ([ncaa.org](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/2/6/media-center-ncaa-announces-transgender-student-athlete-participation-policy-change.aspx?utm_source=openai))
- USOPC and U.S. National Governing Bodies (NGBs):
  - By July 21–24, 2025, the USOPC updated its pages to direct stakeholders to an “Athlete Safety Policy,” and multiple reports and NGB documents reference alignment with EO 14201 and the Ted Stevens Olympic & Amateur Sports Act; USOPC materials and NGB postings (e.g., USA Fencing and USA Cycling) reflect this shift. [24][25][26][27][28] ([usopc.org](https://www.usopc.org/diversity-equity-inclusion/transgender-athlete-participation-in-sport?utm_source=openai))
  - USA Cycling’s updated domestic policy (effective Sept 15, 2025) defines the women’s category consistent with EO 14201/EO 14168 and the USOPC directive. [27][28] ([usacycling.org](https://usacycling.org/about-us/governance/transgender-athletes-policy?utm_source=openai))
- International context:
  - The IOC set a target of early 2026 to announce a new gender‑eligibility policy; media reports note the IOC’s review while stressing the principle of access to sport. [29] ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/47268032/ioc-sets-early-2026-target-new-gender-eligibility-policy?utm_source=openai))

Key questions and likely effects
- Funding leverage: EO 14201’s primary domestic lever is Title IX enforcement and potential rescission of federal education funds from institutions that permit participation inconsistent with the order’s definitions. [1] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Interagency reach and immigration: The order’s direction to State and DHS, including reliance on INA fraud/misrepresentation provisions (8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(C)(i)), extends the policy to immigration screening and visas connected to women’s sports. [1][5] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Litigation environment: The district court’s nationwide vacatur of the 2024 Title IX rule (Tennessee v. Cardona) and Supreme Court arguments in Jan 2026 on state bans create a legal backdrop in which EO 14201’s approach has, to date, been reinforced rather than undermined by federal courts. [17][18][19][20][15][16] ([mcguirewoods.com](https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2025/1/title-ix-final-rule-vacated-nationwide/?utm_source=openai))
- Operational compliance: Post‑EO changes by NCAA and USOPC‑aligned NGBs indicate broad compliance pressures across collegiate and Olympic pathways; ED and HHS enforcement activity (e.g., Maine) illustrates federal willingness to escalate noncompliance to DOJ. [22][24][25][11][12][14] ([ncaa.org](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/2/6/media-center-ncaa-announces-transgender-student-athlete-participation-policy-change.aspx?utm_source=openai))

Compliance checklist for education providers and sports bodies (derived from EO text and agency actions)
- Review and revise athletics eligibility policies to align women’s categories with sex as defined in EO 14168 and enforced via EO 14201. [1][4] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Assess locker room and intimate‑space policies to ensure consistency with the order’s Title IX enforcement priorities. [1] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Prepare for potential ED OCR inquiries; maintain records supporting compliance decisions; monitor DOJ coordination under the Title IX Special Investigations Team. [9][10] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-and-us-department-of-justice-announce-title-ix-special-investigations-team?utm_source=openai))
- For NGBs and clubs connected to the USOPC, align policies with the USOPC Athlete Safety Policy and the Ted Stevens Act guidance referenced by NGB updates. [24][27] ([usopc.org](https://www.usopc.org/diversity-equity-inclusion/transgender-athlete-participation-in-sport?utm_source=openai))
- For international participation, monitor State/DHS guidance regarding entry/visa documentation for athletes seeking to compete in women’s categories. [1][5] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Current status (as of January 19, 2026)
- EO 14201 remains in effect, with the text and directives published in the Federal Register and archived by the American Presidency Project. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- ED and HHS continue active enforcement consistent with the EO; ED recently opened additional investigations tied to school and collegiate athletics policies. [11][12][14] ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/keeping-men-out-womens-sports.html?utm_source=openai))
- Supreme Court decisions that could affect the broader legal landscape for transgender participation in women’s sports are pending following January 2026 arguments.
