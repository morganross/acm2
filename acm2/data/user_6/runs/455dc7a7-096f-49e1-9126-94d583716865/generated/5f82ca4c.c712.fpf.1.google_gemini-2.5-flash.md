## Research Report: Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports

**Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025.** This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports across all educational levels in the United States. The order is rooted in the assertion that women's sports should be reserved exclusively for biological women, defining sex based on "immutable biological classification" from an earlier Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government".

The stated policy of Executive Order 14201 is to protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in fair and safe sports. It characterizes the participation of transgender women in women's sports as "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" to cisgender women and girls, arguing that it denies them equal opportunities to participate and excel. The order also frames this issue within the context of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, asserting that allowing transgender women to compete violates this federal law by depriving biological women of meaningful access to educational facilities.

### Key Provisions and Directives:

Executive Order 14201 outlines several directives for federal departments and agencies to enforce its policy:
*   **Federal Funding Withdrawal:** The order mandates the rescission of federal funding from educational programs that permit transgender women and girls to compete on female sports teams. This is framed as an enforcement action against institutions violating Title IX by "requiring them, in the women's category, to compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males".
*   **Department of Education Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is specifically directed to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions and athletic associations that do not comply with the order's mandate. The Department of Education subsequently urged organizations like the NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) to revoke records of transgender female athletes and reinstate those of cisgender athletes.
*   **Review of Grants:** All executive departments and agencies are required to review grants allocated to educational programs and, where appropriate, withdraw funding from those found to be non-compliant with the executive order's policy.
*   **Department of Justice Support:** The Department of Justice is instructed to provide necessary resources to relevant agencies to ensure the expeditious enforcement of the order.
*   **International Advocacy:** The order also calls for convening State Attorneys General to identify best practices for defining and enforcing equal opportunities in women's sports. It further directs efforts to promote standards consistent with the order at international bodies such as the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee.
*   **Travel Restrictions:** In a significant development on February 25, 2025, the State Department announced a ban on transgender athletes attempting to enter the United States for the purpose of competing in women's sports. Visa applicants suspected of this would have their files marked with 'SWS25'. Additionally, visa applicants who list a gender other than their assigned sex at birth could be permanently banned from entering the U.S. on grounds of "fraud".

### Outcomes and Reactions:

Following the signing of Executive Order 14201, there have been immediate and significant impacts:
*   **NCAA Policy Change:** On February 6, 2025, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) revised its policy to restrict participation in women's college competitions to athletes who were assigned female at birth, effective immediately. This change was met with approval from some, including NCAA president Charlie Baker, who praised the order for providing a "clear, national standard".
*   **Legal Challenges:** The executive order has already faced legal opposition. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 violate the Constitution and Title IX by discriminating against transgender individuals.
*   **Federal Investigations:** The Trump administration initiated investigations into 15 school districts and three colleges for allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' and women's sports.
*   **Broader Context:** Executive Order 14201 is part of a larger series of actions by the Trump administration targeting transgender individuals, with an overall goal to recognize "only two immutable sexes: male and female". This broader effort includes measures such as banning transgender people from military service and restricting gender-affirming healthcare for minors.
*   **State Law Conflicts:** Compliance with Executive Order 14201 could put local education agencies (LEAs) in conflict with state laws that explicitly protect transgender students and athletes, such as those in California, potentially leading to lawsuits.
*   **Supreme Court Debate:** The Supreme Court has been actively debating state laws that ban transgender female students from competing in women's and girls' scholastic sports, with oral arguments taking place in January 2026.

This executive order represents a significant federal intervention in the debate over transgender athletes in sports, aiming to establish a uniform national policy by leveraging federal funding and enforcement mechanisms.
