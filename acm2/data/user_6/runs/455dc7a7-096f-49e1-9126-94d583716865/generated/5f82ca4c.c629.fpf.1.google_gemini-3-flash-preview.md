**Executive Order 14201**, titled "**Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports**," was signed by President Donald J. Trump on **February 5, 2025** [1][3]. This order is a cornerstone of the administration’s broader policy to strictly define biological sex in federal law and restrict transgender women’s participation in spaces reserved for biological females [5][9].

### Core Provisions and Policy Goals
The primary objective of EO 14201 is to prohibit transgender women and girls from competing in female sports across all educational levels, from elementary school through university [3][10]. The order frames this as a measure to ensure "safety, fairness, dignity, and truth" in athletics [3][11].

*   **Federal Funding Rescission**: The order mandates that the federal government rescind all funding from educational programs and institutions that permit transgender women or girls to compete on female sports teams [3][9].
*   **Title IX Enforcement**: It directs the Secretary of Education to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against institutions that allow transgender women to participate in the women's category or require biological females to "appear unclothed before males" in locker rooms [1][7].
*   **Athletic Records**: Following the order, the Department of Education urged organizations like the NCAA and NFHS to revoke the records of transgender female athletes and restore the accolades of the cisgender athletes they replaced [1].

### Relationship to Executive Order 14168
EO 14201 relies on the definitions established in **Executive Order 14168**, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," signed on January 20, 2025 [3][7].
*   **Definition of Sex**: Sex is defined as an "immutable biological classification" determined at birth (or conception), recognizing only the binary categories of male and female [2][11].
*   **Regulatory Alignment**: EO 14201 requires all federal agencies to align their policies with this biological definition, effectively nullifying 2024 Title IX regulations that had expanded protections to include gender identity [2][9].

### Institutional and International Impacts
The order has triggered rapid shifts in both national and international sports governance:
*   **NCAA Policy Change**: On February 6, 2025, the NCAA Board of Governors voted to limit women’s sports competitions exclusively to student-athletes assigned female at birth [2][9]. The policy still allows athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women's teams and receive medical care, but they are barred from official competition [2].
*   **Immigration and Visas**: The order directs the Departments of State and Homeland Security to prevent transgender women from entering the U.S. to compete in women’s sports [1][5]. Reports indicate that visa applicants suspected of such intent may have their files marked with the code "**SWS25**" (Sports Women's Sex 2025) for tracking purposes [1].
*   **Global Advocacy**: The Secretary of State is tasked with promoting these policies at the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) [5][6].

### Legal Challenges and Current Status
As of **January 2026**, the executive order is the subject of intense litigation:
*   **Lawsuits**: In February 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit (*Parker Tirrell and Iris Turmelle v. Trump*), alleging the order violates Fifth Amendment equal protection rights and Title IX [6][12]. Other cases, such as *Minnesota v. Trump*, have also been filed by advocacy groups like the ACLU and Lambda Legal [10].
*   **Supreme Court Involvement**: On January 13, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding state-level transgender sports bans. Conservative justices signaled potential support for these bans, which could provide a legal foundation for the administration's broader federal enforcement of EO 14201 [13].
*   **Sanctuary Cities**: In response to the order, some municipalities, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, have declared themselves "transgender sanctuary cities," pledging to refuse cooperation with federal entities seeking to enforce the order's provisions [6].
