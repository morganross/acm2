**Executive Order 14201**, titled **"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,"** was signed by President Donald Trump on **February 5, 2025**, shortly after his second inauguration [1.4][1.5]. This order establishes a federal policy aimed at prohibiting transgender women and girls from participating in female sports at all educational levels, from K-12 to collegiate athletics [1.4][1.9].

### **1. Policy and Purpose**
The order asserts that the participation of "biological males" in women's sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" and denies women equal opportunity to excel [1.8]. It establishes that the policy of the United States is to:
*   **Rescind federal funding** from any educational institution or program that allows transgender women to compete on female teams [1.4][1.11].
*   **Oppose male participation** in women’s sports as a matter of "safety, fairness, dignity, and truth" [1.8].
*   **Protect all-female spaces**, specifically targeting locker rooms and other private facilities [1.5][1.8].

### **2. Legal Basis and Definitions**
The order relies heavily on the definitions established in **Executive Order 14168** ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"), signed on January 20, 2025 [1.5][1.11].
*   **Sex Definition:** Under these orders, "sex" is defined as an "immutable biological classification" determined by reproductive biology at the time of birth or conception [1.5][1.6].
*   **Title IX Interpretation:** The order reinterprets **Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972**. It argues that allowing transgender women to compete in female categories constitutes a violation of Title IX because it deprives biological women of an "equal opportunity" [1.4][1.13].

### **3. Enforcement Mandates**
Executive Order 14201 directs several departments to take immediate action:
*   **Department of Education:** Must prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against institutions that allow transgender women in female sports or locker rooms [1.8].
*   **Department of State:** Instructed to promote "sex-based female sports" categories internationally, including at the United Nations and with the International Olympic Committee [1.4][1.7].
*   **Department of Justice:** Directed to support these policies through legal resources and to coordinate with state attorneys general to identify "best practices" for enforcement [1.4].
*   **Visa Restrictions:** The State Department has also introduced a ban on transgender athletes entering the U.S. to compete in women's sports, marking relevant visa files with the code 'SWS25' [1.2][1.6].

### **4. Immediate Impact and Consequences**
The order has caused immediate shifts in American athletics:
*   **NCAA Policy Change:** On February 6, 2025, the NCAA revised its participation policy to limit women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth, affecting all three NCAA divisions [1.2][1.9].
*   **Federal Funding Reviews:** The Department of Education quickly initiated reviews of various universities, including San Jose State University, for potential Title IX violations related to athlete participation [1.4][1.5].
*   **State Conflict:** The order creates significant legal friction with states like California, where state laws explicitly protect the rights of transgender students to participate in sports aligned with their gender identity [1.5].

### **5. Legal Challenges and Opposition**
The order has faced swift legal resistance:
*   **New Hampshire Lawsuit:** On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students filed a lawsuit against the administration, alleging that the order violates the Constitution and Title IX [1.4].
*   **Human Rights Criticism:** Advocacy groups have characterized the order as part of a broader "persecution" of transgender individuals, drawing comparisons to historical efforts to marginalize minority groups [1.6][1.10].
