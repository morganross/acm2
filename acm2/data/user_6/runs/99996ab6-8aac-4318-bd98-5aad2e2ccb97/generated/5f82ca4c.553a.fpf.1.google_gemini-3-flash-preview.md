This research report provides a comprehensive analysis of Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," including its policy objectives, enforcement mechanisms, and subsequent legal and international developments.

### **1. Executive Summary**
Executive Order 14201 (EO 14201) was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025, and published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025 (90 FR 9279) [1]. The order establishes a federal policy that prohibits transgender women and girls from participating in female sports at all educational levels [4]. It reinterprets Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to define "sex" strictly as a binary, biological classification determined at birth [7]. The order mandates the rescission of federal funds from institutions that fail to comply and directs the State Department to restrict the entry of foreign transgender athletes into the United States [1], [6].

### **2. Core Provisions and Policy Objectives**
The primary objective of EO 14201 is to "protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports" by excluding individuals assigned male at birth from the female category [1]. 

*   **Title IX Interpretation:** The order asserts that allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports is demeaning and denies biological women equal opportunity. It defines "sex" based on the biological definitions established in EO 14168 (January 20, 2025), which refers to reproductive biology and genetics at conception [1], [2].
*   **Funding Rescission:** Section 3(b) directs all executive departments to review and, where appropriate, rescind federal funding from educational programs that allow biological males to compete in women's sports or access female-only private spaces like locker rooms [5], [12].
*   **Safety and Privacy:** The order prioritizes enforcement against institutions that require female students to "appear unclothed before males" or compete against them, citing concerns for safety, dignity, and privacy [1], [12].

### **3. Implementation and Enforcement Actions**
Following the signing of the order, federal agencies moved rapidly to enforce its provisions:

*   **Department of Education Investigations:** On February 6, 2025, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) launched "directed investigations" into San Jose State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) for alleged Title IX violations involving transgender athlete participation [18], [19]. 
*   **Visa Bans and "SWS25" Tracking:** On February 24, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a directive instructing consular officers to deny visas to transgender athletes attempting to enter the U.S. for women's competitions. Applicants suspected of "misrepresenting" their birth sex face a permanent "fraud bar" (lifetime ban) under the Immigration and Nationality Act. These cases are tracked globally using the code "SWS25" [2], [6], [9].
*   **Department of State Mandates:** The Secretary of State was directed to pressure the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and United Nations to adopt eligibility standards based on biological sex rather than gender identity or testosterone reduction [1], [14].

### **4. Impact on Sports Organizations**
The executive order triggered immediate policy shifts in major athletic governing bodies:

*   **NCAA:** On February 6, 2025, the NCAA Board of Governors updated its policy to restrict women's sports competitions to athletes assigned female at birth, effective immediately [3], [14].
*   **USOPC:** The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) updated its Athlete Safety Policy in July 2025 to ban transgender athletes from women's sports to ensure a competition environment "consistent with Executive Order 14201" [14], [20].
*   **International Bodies:** Pressure from the U.S. administration contributed to a shifting landscape at the IOC, where new President Kirsty Coventry signaled a move toward protecting the female category through science-based reviews of "permanent physical advantages" [22], [30].

### **5. Legal Challenges and Legislative Context**
EO 14201 has faced significant litigation and exists alongside attempted legislative action:

*   **Tirrell and Turmelle v. Edelblut (NH):** Two transgender high school students in New Hampshire expanded an existing lawsuit to include President Trump as a defendant, alleging that EO 14201 violates the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. In June 2025, the federal government moved to dismiss, arguing the order is "rationally related" to preserving fair competition [4], [25], [26].
*   **Rhode Island Lawsuit:** In January 2026, a 12-state coalition led by Rhode Island filed suit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), challenging "gender conditions" on federal grants linked to Trump’s executive orders [20].
*   **Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025:** Parallel to the executive order, the House passed H.R. 28 in January 2025. However, the Senate version (S. 9) failed to pass a cloture vote on March 3, 2025, leaving the executive order as the primary federal mechanism for the ban [10], [15].
