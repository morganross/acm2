## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports – A Detailed Research Report

Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025. The executive order aims to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports across all educational levels. It asserts that the inclusion of individuals designated male at birth in women's sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls" and undermines their equal opportunity and privacy.

### Policy and Purpose

The core policy established by Executive Order 14201 is to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports "as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth". The order states that educational institutions and athletic associations allowing such participation deny women and girls the equal opportunity to excel in competitive sports, thus violating Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.

The Executive Order explicitly relies on definitions set forth in a previous order, Executive Order 14168, issued on January 20, 2025, titled "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government". This antecedent order defines "Sex" as "an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female," emphasizing that "Sex" is not synonymous with "gender identity".

### Key Provisions and Directives

Executive Order 14201 outlines several directives for federal agencies to enforce its policy:
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is mandated to interpret Title IX as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Furthermore, the order directs the Secretary to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions and athletic associations that allow males to compete with or against, or appear unclothed before, females in women's sports categories.
*   **Funding Withdrawal:** The order threatens to rescind federal funding from any elementary, secondary, or post-secondary institution that permits transgender girls to compete on girls' teams, asserting that such actions violate Title IX. All executive departments and agencies are directed to review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, withdraw funding from non-compliant programs.
*   **International Standards:** The Secretary of State is instructed to use all available measures to encourage the International Olympic Committee to amend its standards for Olympic sporting events. The goal is to ensure that eligibility for women's events is determined by sex, rather than gender identity or testosterone reduction.
*   **Immigration and Travel Restrictions:** The State Department announced a ban on transgender athletes entering the United States if they intend to compete in women's sports. Visa applicants suspected of this would have their files marked with 'SWS25'. Additionally, visa applicants who list a gender other than their assigned sex on their application could be permanently banned from entering the U.S. on grounds of "fraud".
*   **Athletic Records:** The Department of Education urged high school and college athletics organizations, such as the NCAA and NFHS, to revoke records held by female transgender athletes and restore those of cisgender athletes.

### Context and Related Legislative Actions

Executive Order 14201 is part of a broader agenda by the Trump administration targeting transgender rights, which also included executive orders focused on defining sexes and restricting transgender military service.

In January 2025, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" of 2025, which aims to restrict transgender students from playing on women's sports teams. This legislation seeks to amend Title IX to define sex based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.

Numerous states have enacted similar legislation. Examples include Idaho's "Fairness in Women's Sports Act" (2020) and West Virginia's "Save Women's Sports Act" (2021), both of which ban transgender women and girls from participating in women's and girls' sports teams at public schools and colleges.

In contrast, earlier in 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on his first day in office aimed at "preventing and combating discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation." This order called on schools to include transgender athletes in sports consistent with their gender identity and signaled that the Justice Department would enforce this through Title IX.

### Reactions and Legal Challenges

Executive Order 14201 has faced immediate opposition and legal challenges. Two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on February 12, 2025, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 unlawfully discriminate against transgender individuals, violating both the Constitution and Title IX.

Furthermore, a multistate lawsuit was filed by Rhode Island's Attorney General, joined by 11 other state attorneys general, against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This lawsuit challenges new "Gender Conditions" on federal grant funding, arguing that these conditions unlawfully discriminate against transgender individuals and are being used to enforce President Trump's executive order.

The implications of such policies are also being debated at the highest judicial level. On January 13, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in cases challenging the constitutionality of state laws in Idaho and West Virginia that ban transgender athletes from women's sports. These cases raise fundamental questions about Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The NCAA also revised its participation policy for transgender student-athletes in response to the order.
