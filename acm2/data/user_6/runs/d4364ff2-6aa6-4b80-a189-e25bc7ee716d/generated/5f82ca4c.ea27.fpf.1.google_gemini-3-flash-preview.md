**Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports**

Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025 [1.3][1.4]. The order established a federal policy aimed at prohibiting transgender women and girls from participating in female athletic categories across all educational levels, asserting that women's sports should be reserved for "biological women" [1.2][1.4].

### **1. Core Policy and Purpose**
The stated purpose of the order is to ensure "safety, fairness, dignity, and truth" in women's athletics [1.2]. It declares that allowing transgender women (referred to as "men" in the text) to compete in women’s categories is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" [1.2]. The order posits that "ignoring fundamental biological truths" deprives female athletes of meaningful access to educational opportunities and privacy [1.2][1.6].

### **2. Key Provisions and Enforcement**
*   **Funding Rescission:** The order directs all executive departments and agencies to review federal grants and rescind funding from any educational programs or institutions that allow transgender women to compete on female teams or access female locker rooms [1.2][1.11].
*   **Title IX Interpretation:** It mandates that the Department of Education interpret Title IX as strictly prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports [1.12]. The Secretary of Education is instructed to prioritize enforcement actions against institutions that require female students to "compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males" [1.2][1.4].
*   **Definitions:** The order adopts the definitions of "sex," "male," and "female" established in Executive Order 14168 ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism"), which defines sex as an "immutable biological classification" based on reproductive biology and genetics at birth [1.2][1.4].
*   **Visa and Entry Restrictions:** The State Department and Department of Homeland Security are tasked with reviewing visa policies. This includes marking files of suspected athletes with "SWS25" (Save Women's Sports 25) to track those seeking entry to compete in women’s sports [1.1][1.7]. Applicants listing a gender other than their sex assigned at birth on visa applications may face permanent bans on grounds of "fraud" [1.1].

### **3. Implementation and Agency Actions**
*   **NCAA Compliance:** Following the order, the NCAA changed its policy on February 6, 2025, to limit women's sports competitions to athletes assigned female at birth [1.1][1.3].
*   **International Advocacy:** The Secretary of State is directed to promote sex-based athletic categories at international bodies, including the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) [1.3][1.5].
*   **Department of Education Review:** The Department immediately began reviewing the athletics policies of universities, such as San Jose State University, for potential Title IX violations [1.3][1.4].

### **4. Legal Status and Challenges**
The executive order has faced significant legal and political opposition:
*   **New Hampshire Lawsuit:** On February 12, 2025, two transgender students filed a lawsuit claiming the order violates the U.S. Constitution and Title IX [1.3].
*   **Supreme Court Involvement:** In January 2026, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in *West Virginia v. B.P.J.*, a landmark case concerning state-level transgender sports bans that overlaps with the federal policy established by EO 14201 [1.9][1.10].
*   **State Conflict:** The order creates a direct conflict with states like California, which have laws explicitly protecting the rights of transgender athletes to participate in sports according to their gender identity [1.4].
