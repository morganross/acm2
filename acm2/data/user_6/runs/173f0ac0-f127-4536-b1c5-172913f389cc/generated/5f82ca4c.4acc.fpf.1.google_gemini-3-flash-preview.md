### 1. Executive Summary
Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025 [1][4][5]. The order establishes a federal policy that prohibits transgender women and girls from participating in female sports at all educational levels, from K-12 to post-secondary institutions [2][4][13]. It utilizes a strict biological definition of sex and directs federal agencies to enforce this standard through Title IX investigations and the potential rescission of federal funding [5][7][13]. As of January 2026, the order is the subject of multiple legal challenges and has prompted major policy changes in national athletic organizations like the NCAA [2][11][20].

### 2. Policy and Purpose
The stated policy of the United States under EO 14201 is to "protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports" [8][9]. The order asserts that allowing biological males to compete in women's sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" and denies women equal opportunity under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 [8][13]. It further declares that "fundamental biological truths" must be recognized to ensure meaningful access to educational facilities for women [8].

### 3. Key Provisions and Enforcement
The order outlines several mandates for federal departments:
*   **Department of Education:** The Secretary of Education is directed to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against institutions that allow transgender women to compete in female categories or access female locker rooms [5][13]. The department is also tasked with reviewing and rescinding federal grants to non-compliant programs [5][11].
*   **Department of State:** The Secretary of State is directed to promote sex-based female sports categories internationally, specifically at the United Nations and with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) [4][7].
*   **Department of Justice:** The Attorney General is tasked with providing resources for the "expeditious enforcement" of these policies and convening state attorneys general to establish best practices for defining and enforcing equal opportunities [3][7].

### 4. Interplay with Executive Order 14168
Executive Order 14201 adopts the definitions established in the earlier Executive Order 14168 ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government") [5][15]. 
*   **Definition of Sex:** Under these orders, "sex" is defined as an "immutable biological classification as either male or female" [13][15]. 
*   **Exclusion of Gender Identity:** The orders explicitly state that "sex" is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of "gender identity" [13][15].

### 5. Implementation and Impact (2025–2026)
Following the signing of the order, several immediate actions were taken:
*   **NCAA Policy Change:** On February 6, 2025, the NCAA Board of Governors updated its policy to limit participation in women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth, citing the "clear, national standard" provided by the executive order [2][11][20].
*   **Federal Investigations:** The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) launched proactive investigations into several entities on February 6, 2025, including:
    *   **San Jose State University (SJSU):** Investigated regarding a transgender player on its women's volleyball team [16][20][21].
    *   **University of Pennsylvania:** Investigated regarding its women's swimming and diving program [16][21][23].
    *   **Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA):** Investigated for allowing transgender participation in high school girls' basketball [16][21].
*   **Visa Restrictions (SWS25):** On February 25, 2025, the State Department issued a directive to deny visas to transgender athletes attempting to enter the U.S. to compete in women's sports [2][11][12]. Files for such applicants are marked with the tracking code **"SWS25"** [2][3][11]. Applicants listing a gender other than their sex assigned at birth on visa applications may face permanent bans on grounds of "fraud" [2][12].

### 6. Legal Challenges and Current Status
The order has faced significant legal opposition:
*   ***Tirrell v. Edelblut*:** On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the administration, challenging EO 14201 as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX [4][14][17]. As of late 2025, this case was held in abeyance pending Supreme Court decisions [17].
*   **Supreme Court Oral Arguments:** On January 13, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in *West Virginia v. B.P.J.* and *Little v. Hecox* [10][18][20]. These cases, while focusing on state-level bans, are expected to establish the constitutional framework that will determine the ultimate legality of Executive Order 14201 [10][25][26]. During arguments, conservative justices expressed concerns that including transgender girls could "undermine or reverse" the successes of women's sports [18][26].
