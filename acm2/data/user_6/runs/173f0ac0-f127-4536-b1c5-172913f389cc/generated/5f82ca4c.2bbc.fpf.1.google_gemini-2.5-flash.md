## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports – A Detailed Research Report

**Executive Order 14201**, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025. This executive order establishes a federal policy aimed at prohibiting individuals identified as male from competing in women's and girls' sports at all educational levels. It underscores a broader governmental stance against what it terms "gender ideology extremism" and seeks to restore a biological interpretation of sex within federal policies.

### Policy and Purpose

The central objective of Executive Order 14201 is to safeguard opportunities for women and girls in competitive sports. The order asserts that the participation of males in women's sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous," and actively undermines the equal opportunities guaranteed to women and girls under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. The policy of the United States, as outlined in the order, is to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports across a broader spectrum, emphasizing principles of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth. It further states that denying women meaningful access to educational facilities by "ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes" is problematic.

### Key Provisions and Directives

Executive Order 14201 incorporates definitions from a preceding order, Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," which defines "sex" as an "immutable biological classification" of "male" or "female".

The order mandates several specific actions across federal agencies:
*   **Education and Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is directed to take appropriate measures to protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms. This includes prioritizing Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions and athletic associations that compel female students to compete with or against males in women's categories, or appear unclothed before them.
*   **Funding Rescission:** The policy explicitly aims to rescind federal funding from educational programs that permit transgender women and girls to compete on female sports teams. All executive departments and agencies are required to review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, withdraw funding from those that do not comply with the order's policy.
*   **Interpretation of Title IX:** The order stipulates that Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in schools, should be interpreted to ban the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Educational institutions not in compliance risk losing federal funding.
*   **Broader Federal Policy Changes:** Executive Order 14201 builds upon and reinforces Executive Order 14168, which calls for broader changes across the federal government. This includes requiring government-issued identification documents and federal personnel records to accurately reflect an individual's sex (male or female) and prohibiting the request for gender identity on agency forms. Federal agencies are also instructed to remove policies, statements, regulations, or communications that promote "gender ideology" and cease federal funding of such.
*   **Protection in Intimate Spaces:** The Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security are tasked with ensuring that males are not housed in women's prisons or detention centers, including through amendments to federal regulations if necessary.
*   **International Engagement:** The order also directs actions to promote standards consistent with its policy at the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee.
*   **Rescission of Previous Orders:** Executive Order 14201 explicitly supersedes and rescinds several previous executive orders and presidential memoranda, including Executive Orders 13988, 14004, 14020, 14021, and 14075. It also dissolves the White House Gender Policy Council, which was established by Executive Order 14020.

### Legal Challenges

Following its issuance, Executive Order 14201, along with Executive Order 14168, faced legal challenges. At least one lawsuit was filed by two transgender high school students in New Hampshire on February 12, 2025. This lawsuit contends that the executive orders discriminate against transgender individuals, violating their Fifth Amendment equal protection rights and conflicting with Title IX. The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the order is unconstitutional and unlawful, a permanent injunction, and nominal damages.

### Impact

In response to the executive order, the Department of Education promptly initiated a review of the athletics policies of universities and athletic associations that had supported the participation of transgender women and girls in female sports, assessing potential Title IX violations. Additionally, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) revised its participation policy for transgender student-athletes.
