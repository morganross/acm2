Research report: Executive Order 14201—“Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports”

Summary and status
- What it is: Executive Order (EO) 14201 is a presidential order signed on February 5, 2025, directing the federal government to ensure that participation in women’s and girls’ sports at federally funded educational institutions is based on sex as defined in federal policy, not gender identity, and to withhold or rescind funding from non‑compliant programs. It was published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Relationship to other EOs: EO 14201 incorporates definitions from EO 14168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”) issued January 20, 2025, which sets agency‑wide definitions of “male” and “female.” [4] ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/?utm_source=openai))
- White House framing: A same‑day White House fact sheet says the EO “upholds the promise of Title IX,” requires DOJ to respect the nationwide vacatur of the 2024 Title IX rule, and directs immediate enforcement actions, as well as engagement with sports governing bodies and pressure on the IOC; it also mentions DHS visa policy reviews tied to sports eligibility.

Key directives in the text of EO 14201
- Funding enforcement under Title IX: Directs all federal agencies to review grants and, “where appropriate, rescind funding” from educational programs that permit male participation in women’s sports, and directs DOJ to provide resources for expeditious enforcement. [1] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Education Department actions: Directs the Secretary of Education (in coordination with the Attorney General) to align policy and enforcement with the order, “affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities,” and prioritize Title IX enforcement against institutions (and associations of institutions) that require women to compete with or appear unclothed before males in the women’s category. [1] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Definitions: Adopts the definitional framework of EO 14168 for “male” and “female” across the federal government for purposes of the order. [1][4] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- International and immigration components: Directs the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to review and adjust policies to prevent the entry of “males seeking to participate in women’s sports” to the extent permitted by law; instructs State to use all appropriate measures to press the International Olympic Committee to ensure eligibility for women’s events is determined by sex, not gender identity or testosterone levels. [1] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Policy coordination: Instructs the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy to convene athletic organizations and affected female athletes, and coordinate with state attorneys general to identify best practices. [1][3] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Implementation to date (federal agencies)
- HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR): Announced a compliance review of the State of Maine’s education agencies for purported noncompliance with EO 14201 and Title IX, explicitly tying enforcement to the EO and noting the funding‑review mandate. [5] ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/keeping-men-out-womens-sports.html?utm_source=openai))
- U.S. Department of Education (ED): Issued a press statement endorsing the EO and signaling prioritization of Title IX enforcement consistent with the order. [7] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports?utm_source=openai))
- U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS/USCIS): Announced policy‑manual updates to align with EO 14201, clarifying certain athlete‑visa categories and stating the aim to prevent “male” athletes from being authorized to compete in women’s sports in the U.S. [6] ([uscis.gov](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-updating-policy-to-protect-womens-sports?utm_source=openai))

Downstream responses by major sports bodies
- NCAA: On February 6, 2025, the NCAA adopted a nationwide policy limiting participation in women’s college sports to athletes assigned female at birth, replacing its prior sport‑by‑sport framework; coverage tied the timing and rationale to EO 14201. [8] ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0850b452de89674aeac7c6b1d8bce6d5?utm_source=openai))
- U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC): Updated its public guidance to direct readers to its “Athlete Safety Policy” and, in that policy and related reporting, indicated compliance with EO 14201 and the Ted Stevens Olympic & Amateur Sports Act; news coverage and the USOPC site point to the July 2025 policy shift and letters to national governing bodies. [9][10] ([usopc.org](https://www.usopc.org/diversity-equity-inclusion/transgender-athlete-participation-in-sport?utm_source=openai))
- USA Cycling (NGB): Issued a formal “Competition Category Policy” effective September 15, 2025, limiting the women’s category to those meeting its sex‑based definition and citing USOPC requirements and EO 14201/EO 14168 as predicates. [11] ([usacycling.org](https://usacycling.org/about-us/governance/transgender-athletes-policy?utm_source=openai))

Litigation and legal context
- Title IX rule background: On January 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky (State of Tennessee v. Cardona) vacated the 2024 Title IX regulations nationwide, a ruling repeatedly referenced by the administration when implementing EO 14201. [14][3] ([politico.com](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/09/federal-judge-vacates-bidens-title-ix-rule-00197353?utm_source=openai))
- State and institutional enforcement climate: Reporting indicates that by January 14, 2026, the Education Department had opened at least 18 investigations into K‑12 districts and colleges for allowing transgender participation in girls’ and women’s sports, reflecting the EO’s enforcement posture. [12] ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2026/01/14/trump-administration-trans-athletes-investigations/?utm_source=openai))
- Supreme Court landscape: As of January 2026 arguments, the Court appeared poised to uphold state‑level bans on transgender athletes in girls’ and women’s sports, a decision that could further shape how EO 14201 interacts with Title IX and state laws. [13] ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/a0e50014fbf7f3ef5b1d1e9b5e8b662d?utm_source=openai))
- State challenges to the EO: Minnesota’s Attorney General sued in April 2025 to block the “Sports Ban Order,” arguing constitutional and statutory defects and asserting that the EO does not override Minnesota’s civil‑rights protections; the office also issued a prior binding state AG opinion to that effect. [12] ([ag.state.mn.us](https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2025/04/22_EO_TitleIX.asp))

Practical implications for education and sport
- Federally funded schools and athletic associations face heightened Title IX risk if they permit transgender women or girls to compete in women’s categories; agencies have been directed to review grants and, when appropriate, rescind funds, and DOJ has been tasked with supporting enforcement. [1][5][7][12] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- National sport governance has shifted toward sex‑based eligibility standards in women’s categories at the collegiate level (NCAA) and within Olympic pathways (USOPC and several NGBs), citing EO 14201 and federal expectations. [8][9][10][11] ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/0850b452de89674aeac7c6b1d8bce6d5?utm_source=openai))
- International and immigration dimensions include direction to press the IOC to adopt sex‑based eligibility criteria and DHS/State reviews of visa/entry policies for athletes, with USCIS already updating guidance. [1][6][3] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Open questions to monitor
- Final Supreme Court decisions on state bans (expected by mid‑2026) and their interaction with federal Title IX enforcement under EO 14201. [13] ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/a0e50014fbf7f3ef5b1d1e9b5e8b662d?utm_source=openai))
- Additional agency rulemaking or guidance under EO 14201 (ED, DOJ, HHS, State, DHS) and the scope of funding actions taken against non‑compliant entities. [1][5][6][7] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Ongoing and new litigation against the EO or related enforcement actions by states, institutions, athletes, or advocacy groups. [12][14] ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2026/01/14/trump-administration-trans-athletes-investigations/?utm_source=openai))
