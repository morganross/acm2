## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports – A Detailed Research Report

**Washington, D.C.** – On February 5, 2025, former President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports." This executive order seeks to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports across all educational levels in the United States. The order is rooted in the administration's interpretation of "biological sex" as established in a preceding Executive Order 14168, which defined sex as an "immutable biological classification as either male or female".

### Policy and Purpose

The primary stated purpose of Executive Order 14201 is to "protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports". The order asserts that the participation of individuals identified as male in women's sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls" and "denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports". It further contends that allowing such participation violates Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. The order references federal court recognitions that "ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities".

### Key Provisions

Executive Order 14201 outlines several directives for federal agencies and educational institutions:

*   **Federal Funding Rescission:** The order mandates the rescission of all federal funds from educational programs that "deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities" by allowing transgender female athletes to participate in female sports.
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** It directs the Secretary of Education to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions, including athletic associations, that permit individuals identified as male to compete with or against females in women's sports, or to appear unclothed before them in associated facilities.
*   **Definition of Sex:** The order explicitly states that the definitions provided in Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," signed on January 20, 2025, apply. This prior order defined "sex" as "an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female" and specified that "sex" is not synonymous with "gender identity".
*   **International Advocacy:** The Secretary of State is directed to utilize all appropriate measures to encourage the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations to amend their standards for Olympic sporting events to ensure that eligibility for women's sporting events is determined by sex assigned at birth, disregarding gender identity or testosterone reduction.
*   **Immigration Policies:** The order also instructs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to review and adjust policies concerning the entry of transgender athletes into the United States if they intend to compete in women's sports, and to issue guidance to prevent such entry.

### Impact and Reactions

Following the issuance of Executive Order 14201, the Department of Education urged high school and college athletics organizations, such as the NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), to revoke the records of transgender female athletes and restore those of cisgender athletes. The NCAA subsequently revised its participation policy to limit college competitions in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth, effective immediately. NCAA President Charlie Baker expressed that the organization would comply with the executive order, praising it for providing a "clear, national standard".

The order has been met with legal challenges. At least one lawsuit was filed on February 12, 2025, by two transgender high school students in New Hampshire against the Trump administration, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 violate the Constitution and Title IX.

This executive order stands in contrast to an earlier executive order signed by President Joe Biden on his first day in office (January 20, 2021), which aimed to prevent and combat discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, calling on schools to allow transgender athletes to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity.
