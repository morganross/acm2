**Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports** was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025 [1.1, 1.10]. The order established a federal policy that defines "sex" based on biological classification at birth and mandates the exclusion of transgender women and girls from female-designated athletic competitions at all educational levels [1.2, 1.5].

### **1. Official Overview and Signing Details**
*   **Title:** Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports [1.8]
*   **Date Signed:** February 5, 2025 [1.13]
*   **Federal Register Citation:** 90 FR 9279 (published February 11, 2025) [1.14]
*   **Presidential Authority:** Issued under the authority vested by the Constitution and laws of the United States, specifically targeting the interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 [1.10, 1.13].

### **2. Core Policy and Definitions**
The order relies on definitions established in **Executive Order 14168** ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"), signed on January 20, 2025 [1.4, 1.5].
*   **Definition of Sex:** Defined as an individual’s "immutable biological classification as either male or female," determined at conception or birth [1.2, 1.5].
*   **Rationale:** The order asserts that allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" and deprives biological women of fair athletic opportunities and privacy [1.10, 1.13].

### **3. Key Provisions and Directives**
The executive order includes several mandates for federal agencies to enforce this new policy:
*   **Rescission of Federal Funding:** All federal executive departments and agencies are directed to review grants to educational programs. Programs that permit transgender women or girls to compete on female sports teams are subject to the rescission of federal funds [1.2, 1.4].
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is ordered to prioritize enforcement actions against schools and athletic associations that allow biological males in women's categories or locker rooms [1.5, 1.10].
*   **Department of Justice (DOJ) Role:** The DOJ is directed to provide resources for enforcement and to convene State Attorneys General to identify best practices for maintaining sex-separated sports [1.2, 1.10].
*   **International Outreach:** The order instructs federal agencies to promote these standards at the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) [1.3, 1.8].

### **4. Immediate Impact and Outcomes**
The issuance of EO 14201 led to immediate changes in the national sports landscape:
*   **NCAA Policy Change:** On February 6, 2025, the day after the order was signed, the NCAA revised its participation policy to limit women’s sports competitions to athletes assigned female at birth [1.1, 1.4].
*   **Federal Investigations:** The Department of Education quickly initiated reviews of athletic policies at various institutions, including San Jose State University, for potential Title IX violations related to transgender participation [1.6].
*   **Visa and Entry Restrictions:** Following the order, the State Department reportedly announced bans or marking systems for transgender athletes seeking to enter the U.S. to compete in women's sports [1.1].

### **5. Legal Challenges**
The order has faced immediate litigation from advocacy groups and individuals:
*   **New Hampshire Lawsuit:** On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students filed a lawsuit claiming EO 14201 violates the Constitution and Title IX by discriminating on the basis of gender identity [1.3].
*   **Constitutional Debate:** Legal experts note that the order challenges previous interpretations of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, which found that discrimination based on gender identity is inherently sex discrimination [1.3, 1.11].
