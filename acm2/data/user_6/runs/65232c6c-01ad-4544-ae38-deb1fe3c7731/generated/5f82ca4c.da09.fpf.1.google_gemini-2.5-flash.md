Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025. This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women athletes from competing on girls' and women's sports teams across all educational levels, from elementary schools to post-secondary institutions. The stated purpose of the order is to protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports.

**Policy and Definitions**

The executive order establishes that it is the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports, citing concerns about safety, fairness, dignity, and truth. It asserts that allowing men to compete in women's sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls," and denies them equal opportunity, potentially violating Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.

Executive Order 14201 relies on definitions set forth in a prior directive, Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," issued on January 20, 2025. This preceding order defines "sex" as an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female at birth, explicitly stating that "sex" is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of "gender identity".

**Key Provisions and Directives**

The executive order includes several directives aimed at implementing its policy:
*   **Federal Funding:** It threatens to rescind federal funding from any educational programs or institutions (including athletic associations) that allow transgender girls or women to participate in girls' or women's sports, claiming such actions violate Title IX.
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is directed to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions that are deemed to deny female students equal athletic opportunities by requiring them to compete with or against, or appear unclothed before, males in the women's category.
*   **Grant Review:** All executive departments and agencies are instructed to review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding from programs that do not comply with the order's policy.
*   **International Standards:** The Secretary of State is mandated to use all appropriate measures to encourage the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee to amend their standards for Olympic sporting events to ensure eligibility for women's events is determined by sex, not gender identity or testosterone reduction.
*   **Travel Restrictions:** The State Department announced a ban on transgender athletes entering the U.S. if they intend to compete in women's sports. Visa applicants suspected of this will have their files marked with 'SWS25,' and those listing a gender other than their assigned sex on visa applications could face a permanent ban for "fraud".

**Reactions and Outcomes**

The executive order has elicited significant reactions and led to policy changes and legal challenges:
*   **NCAA Policy Change:** In response to the executive order, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) revised its policy on February 6, 2025, to limit competition in women's sports to student-athletes who were assigned female at birth. Under this updated policy, transgender women student-athletes may practice with women's teams and receive benefits, but are not permitted to compete. Men's sports remain open to all eligible student-athletes. The NCAA president, Charlie Baker, stated the organization would comply with the executive order and praised it for providing a "clear, national standard".
*   **Department of Education Actions:** The Department of Education has urged high school and college athletics organizations to revoke records held by transgender female athletes and restore those of cisgender athletes, aiming to "restore athletic records to women who have for years been devalued, ignored and forced to watch men steal their accolades". The department also immediately began reviewing the athletics policies of universities and associations that supported the participation of transgender women and girls for possible Title IX violations.
*   **Legislative Efforts:** In January 2025, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" of 2025, which seeks to amend Title IX to define sex solely based on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth, thereby restricting transgender students from playing on women's sports teams. However, Senate Democrats blocked an attempt to codify this ban and the executive order.
*   **Legal Challenges:** The executive order and related policies have faced legal opposition. Two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit on February 12, 2025, challenging Executive Orders 14168 and 14201, alleging discrimination against transgender individuals in violation of the Constitution and Title IX. The U.S. Supreme Court is also hearing challenges to state laws in Idaho and West Virginia that ban transgender athletes from women's sports, with the court appearing likely to uphold these bans. These cases center on whether such laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title IX.
