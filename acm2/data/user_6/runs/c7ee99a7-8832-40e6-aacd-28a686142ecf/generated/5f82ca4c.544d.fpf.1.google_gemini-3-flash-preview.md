**Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports** was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025 [1.2, 1.3]. The order establishes a federal policy to restrict participation in women’s sports to individuals based on their biological sex as determined at birth, effectively prohibiting transgender women and girls from competing on female athletic teams at all educational levels [1.2, 1.8].

### **1. Policy and Purpose**
The order declares that the participation of biological males in women’s sports is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls" [1.13, 1.4]. It asserts that allowing such participation violates **Title IX** of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 by depriving biological women of equal athletic opportunities and privacy [1.3, 1.13]. The administration's stated goal is to "restore biological truth" and protect the safety and dignity of female athletes [1.13, 1.14].

### **2. Definitions and Scope**
Executive Order 14201 relies on the definitions established in **Executive Order 14168** ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"), signed on January 20, 2025 [1.2, 1.13]. 
*   **Biological Sex:** Defined as an "immutable biological classification" determined at conception [1.3, 1.6]. 
*   **Binary Model:** Recognizes only two sexes, male and female, based on the size of reproductive cells produced [1.10].
*   **Inclusion:** The order explicitly excludes transgender women and girls from the "female" category while not placing similar restrictions on transgender men participating in male sports [1.10, 1.15].

### **3. Key Provisions**
The order mandates several aggressive enforcement mechanisms across the federal government:
*   **Rescission of Federal Funding:** The federal government will withhold all federal funds from educational institutions—including K-12 schools and universities—that allow transgender women to compete on female teams [1.2, 1.15].
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is directed to prioritize enforcement actions against institutions that require biological females to compete against males or "appear unclothed before males" in locker rooms [1.3, 1.13].
*   **International Diplomacy:** The Secretary of State is tasked with promoting these sex-based standards at the **United Nations** and the **International Olympic Committee (IOC)** [1.9, 1.14].
*   **Visa and Entry Restrictions:** The State Department and Department of Homeland Security are directed to review policies allowing transgender women to enter the U.S. for athletic competition [1.5]. This has resulted in a ban on transgender athletes entering the country to compete in women's sports, with visa files of suspected applicants marked with the code **'SWS25'** (Save Women's Sports 25) for tracking [1.1, 1.10].

### **4. Implementation and Institutional Impact**
Major athletic and educational bodies have already altered their policies in response to the order:
*   **NCAA:** On February 6, 2025—the day after the order was signed—the NCAA changed its policy to limit women’s competitions to athletes assigned female at birth [1.1, 1.4].
*   **USOPC:** The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee banned transgender athletes from women's sports in July 2025, citing an "obligation to comply with federal expectations" [1.14].
*   **Department of Education:** Investigations were immediately launched into institutions such as **San Jose State University** for potential Title IX violations related to transgender athlete participation [1.6, 1.12].

### **5. Legal Challenges and Opposition**
The order has faced immediate litigation and resistance:
*   **New Hampshire Lawsuit:** On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students filed a lawsuit claiming the order violates the Constitution and Title IX [1.2].
*   **Multistate Lawsuit:** In January 2026, a coalition of 12 states led by Rhode Island sued the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), arguing that the "Gender Conditions" attached to federal grants are unlawful and discriminatory [1.17].
*   **State Conflict:** In states like **California**, where state law protects transgender athletes, local educational agencies face a "legal bind" between losing federal funding for complying with state law or facing state-level lawsuits for complying with the executive order [1.6].
