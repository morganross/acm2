Research report: Executive Order 14201—“Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports”

Executive summary
- Executive Order (EO) 14201 was signed on February 5, 2025 and published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025. It states that allowing “men to compete in women’s sports” is “demeaning, unfair, and dangerous,” and sets an Executive Branch policy to rescind federal funds from education programs that, in the Administration’s view, deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities under Title IX. [1][2]
- EO 14201 incorporates the definitions set in EO 14168 (“Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”), which directs agencies to rely on sex-based (not gender-identity–based) terminology across federal policy. [1][3][4]
- The order instructs the Department of Education (ED), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of State, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take specified steps, including prioritizing Title IX enforcement actions, reviewing grants and rescinding funding where appropriate, pressing international sports bodies (including the International Olympic Committee) to adopt sex-based eligibility, and reviewing visa policies related to athletes. [1]
- EO 14201 explicitly references ongoing Title IX litigation, and directs ED to “continue to comply” with the nationwide vacatur of the 2024 Title IX rule issued by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky in State of Tennessee v. Cardona (Jan. 9, 2025). [1][5][6][7]

What EO 14201 does (by section)
- Section 1 (Policy and purpose)
  - Asserts that some institutions allow “men to compete in women’s sports,” which the order says violates equal athletic opportunity under Title IX; sets U.S. policy to rescind federal funds from programs that “deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.” [1]
- Section 2 (Definitions)
  - Incorporates definitions from EO 14168 (Jan. 20, 2025), directing agencies to apply those definitions to EO 14201. [1][3][4]
- Section 3 (Preserving women’s sports in education)
  - Directs the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Attorney General, to “continue to comply” with the vacatur of the April 29, 2024 Title IX rule (89 Fed. Reg. 33474) and to take steps to ensure the rule “does not have effect.” [1]
  - Directs ED to “affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms,” and to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions (and athletic associations they govern) that, in the women’s category, require female students “to compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males.” [1]
  - Requires all federal agencies to review grants to educational programs and, “where appropriate,” rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy. [1]
  - Directs DOJ to provide resources to ensure expeditious enforcement. [1]
- Section 4 (Preserving fairness and safety in women’s sports)
  - Tasks the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy to convene major athletic organizations and governing bodies, and state attorneys general, to promote policies “fair and safe” for female athletes. [1]
  - Directs the Secretary of State to (i) rescind support for sports exchanges that base female categories on identity rather than sex; (ii) promote international rules that protect a sex-based female category; (iii) with DHS, review admission policies to the United States for “males seeking to participate in women’s sports” and issue guidance to prevent entry where permitted by law; and (iv) “use all appropriate and available measures” to press the International Olympic Committee to set eligibility for women’s events “according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction.” [1]
- Section 5 (General provisions)
  - Standard implementation clauses, including consistency with law and appropriations; disclaimers of enforceable rights. [1]

Relationship to EO 14168
- EO 14201 explicitly adopts the definitions in EO 14168. EO 14168, published in the Federal Register on January 30, 2025, directs agencies to use sex-based terminology and rescinds earlier executive orders that had used gender identity frameworks; subsequent agency materials reference implementing EO 14168. [1][3][4][8][9]

Legal and regulatory backdrop: Title IX rule litigation
- The Biden Administration’s 2024 Title IX rule (issued April 29, 2024; 89 Fed. Reg. 33474) was challenged in multiple lawsuits. On July 2, 2024, a federal court in Kansas granted a preliminary injunction for several states in Kansas v. U.S. Department of Education. [10]
- On January 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky vacated the 2024 Title IX rule nationwide in State of Tennessee v. Cardona, finding it contrary to law, unconstitutional in part, and arbitrary and capricious; as a result, the 2020 Title IX rule framework was restored. [5][6][7]
- EO 14201 directs ED to “continue to comply” with that vacatur and to ensure the 2024 rule does not take effect. [1]

Enforcement mechanics and limits under Title IX
- Title IX enforcement allows funding termination or “any other means authorized by law,” but agencies must first provide notice, attempt voluntary compliance, and (for termination) provide a hearing and a 30‑day report to Congress before funds are cut. These processes are embedded in the statute and agency regulations and typically include potential referral to DOJ for litigation. [11][12][13][14][15]
- Because funding termination is procedurally demanding and rare, agencies often pursue negotiated resolution agreements or DOJ litigation rather than immediate termination. EO 14201’s call to “rescind funding” must operate within these Title IX statutory and regulatory procedures. [11][12][13][14][15]

Practical implications by stakeholder
- Federally funded educational institutions (K‑12 and higher ed)
  - EO 14201 signals heightened Title IX enforcement focused on sex-separated athletics and facilities; institutions face grant reviews and potential funding consequences if found noncompliant, subject to Title IX’s procedural requirements. [1][11][12]
- Athletic associations and governing bodies connected to schools
  - Associations “composed of or governed by” educational institutions are identified as potential targets of prioritized Title IX enforcement actions, increasing pressure to adopt sex-based eligibility rules for women’s categories in school-affiliated competition. [1]
- International and national sport governance
  - The Secretary of State is directed to press the International Olympic Committee and international federations toward sex-based eligibility for women’s events; while an EO cannot bind international bodies, this sets U.S. diplomatic policy and may affect U.S. participation in certain exchanges. [1]
- Immigration/visas for athletes
  - State and DHS are directed to review policies for admission to the U.S. and issue guidance intended to prevent entry of “males seeking to participate in women’s sports,” to the extent permitted by law (citing INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)(i))). Any such implementation would be subject to immigration statutes and due process. [1]

Open questions and litigation risk
- EO 14201 relies on agency action using Title IX enforcement tools. Any move to terminate or condition funds must follow Title IX’s processes and remains subject to judicial review under the APA and Title IX’s review provisions. [11][12][13][15]
- The scope of “any other means authorized by law” (e.g., DOJ suits to enforce compliance) is recognized but bounded by regulations and case law. Implementation choices may prompt additional litigation from recipients, students, or advocacy organizations. [12][13][15]
- Because the 2024 Title IX rule was vacated nationwide, the Administration’s position in EO 14201 aligns with the current status quo ante of Title IX regulations; however, further court decisions or future rulemaking could alter the legal landscape. [5][6][7]
