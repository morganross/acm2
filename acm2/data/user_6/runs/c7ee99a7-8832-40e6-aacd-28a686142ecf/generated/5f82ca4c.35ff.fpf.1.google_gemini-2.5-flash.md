## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports

**Washington D.C.**—On February 5, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14201, officially titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports". This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports at all educational levels, asserting that such participation undermines fairness and safety in women's athletics.

### Policy and Purpose

The core policy established by Executive Order 14201 is to prevent individuals assigned male at birth from competing in women's sports. The order contends that allowing "men to compete in women's sports is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports". It argues that this practice violates Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. The order's underlying definitions of "male" and "female" are derived from Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," which defines sex based on reproductive biology and genetics at conception.

### Key Provisions and Directives

Executive Order 14201 outlines several mandates to achieve its objectives:

*   **Federal Funding Rescission**: The order directs the United States government to rescind federal funding from educational programs that permit transgender women and girls to compete on female sports teams.
*   **Title IX Enforcement**: The Secretary of Education is tasked with prioritizing Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions that allow male competitive participation in women's sports, which the order considers a denial of equal opportunity for female students.
*   **International Standards**: The Secretary of State is instructed to use available measures to encourage the International Olympic Committee to amend its standards for Olympic sporting events. The goal is to ensure eligibility for women's events is determined by sex, rather than gender identity or testosterone reduction.
*   **Guidance for State Attorneys General**: The order calls for convening State Attorneys General to identify and promote best practices for defining and enforcing equal athletic opportunities for women.
*   **Immigration Restrictions**: The State Department has implemented a ban on transgender athletes entering the U.S. if they intend to compete in women's sports. Additionally, visa applicants who list a gender other than their sex assigned at birth may face permanent bans for "fraud".

### Reactions and Outcomes

Following the issuance of Executive Order 14201, significant actions and reactions have been observed:

*   **NCAA Policy Change**: The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) announced its compliance with the executive order, revising its policy to limit participation in college women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth.
*   **Department of Education Actions**: The Department of Education urged high school and college athletic organizations to revoke records of transgender female athletes and reinstate those of cisgender athletes. It also initiated reviews of university and athletic association policies that had supported transgender women's participation for potential Title IX violations.
*   **Legal Challenges**: The executive order has faced immediate legal opposition. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 unlawfully discriminate against transgender individuals and violate the Constitution and Title IX.
*   **Congressional Support**: In January 2025, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" of 2025. This bill seeks to amend Title IX by explicitly defining sex based on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth, aligning with the executive order's stance.

The executive order is part of a broader series of actions by the Trump administration that impact transgender individuals, including restrictions on gender-affirming care, government employment, and international travel.
