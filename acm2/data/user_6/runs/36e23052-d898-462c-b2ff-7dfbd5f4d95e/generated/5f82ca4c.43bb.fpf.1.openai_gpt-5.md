Research report: Executive Order 14201—“Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports”
Date: January 19, 2026

Executive summary
- What it is: Executive Order (EO) 14201, signed February 5, 2025, directs the federal government to condition funding and policy engagement on maintaining women’s sports as sex-based categories and to oppose “male competitive participation in women’s sports.” [1][2][3] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Legal hooks: The order invokes Title IX as authority to pursue enforcement actions (including rescinding funds after required procedures) and cites federal court rulings vacating the 2024 Title IX rule; it also cross-references EO 14168 for controlling definitions of “sex,” “male,” and “female.” [1][4][5][6][7][18][19] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Implementation to date: Education (ED/OCR) announced return to the 2020 Title IX rule and launched directed investigations; HHS/OCR opened a compliance review; USCIS moved to align athlete-related immigration benefits with EO 14201; the NCAA adopted a policy limiting women’s competition to athletes assigned female at birth. [9][10][11][12][13][15] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-enforce-2020-title-ix-rule-protecting-women?utm_source=openai))
- Litigation and landscape: As of mid‑January 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court appears poised to uphold state bans on transgender participation in girls’/women’s sports in cases from Idaho and West Virginia, a backdrop likely to influence future Title IX litigation and the EO’s enforcement environment.

What the order does (text and structure)
- Section 1 (Policy and Purpose): Declares that allowing “men to compete in women’s sports” is unfair and dangerous; states the federal policy to rescind funds from educational programs that deny women “fair athletic opportunities,” and to oppose male participation in women’s sports as a matter of “safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.” [1][2][3] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Section 2 (Definitions): Incorporates definitions from EO 14168 (Jan. 20, 2025), which defines sex as an immutable biological classification and provides controlling definitions for “men,” “women,” “male,” and “female” for executive-branch interpretation. [1][18][19] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Section 3 (Education/Title IX): Directs the Secretary of Education, in coordination with DOJ, to comply with the nationwide vacatur of the April 29, 2024 Title IX rule, prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against institutions that compel women to compete with or appear unclothed before males in women’s categories, and for agencies to review grants and rescind funding, where appropriate, from noncompliant programs. [1][6][7] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Section 4 (Sports governance, immigration, and diplomacy): Orders the White House Domestic Policy staff to convene athletic organizations and harmed athletes; directs State and DHS to review and adjust entry policies regarding “males seeking to participate in women’s sports,” including use of INA §212(a)(6)(C)(i) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)) on misrepresentation; and instructs State to push for IOC standards based on sex rather than gender identity. [1][14] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Publication and timing: The order was signed February 5, 2025 and published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025. [1][3] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Statutory and regulatory authorities referenced
- Title IX core prohibition: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in… any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. §1681. [4] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681?utm_source=openai))
- Title IX enforcement mechanism: Any termination or refusal of funds requires notice, opportunity for hearing, findings on the record, and is limited to the particular program or part thereof; agencies may also use “other means authorized by law.” 20 U.S.C. §1682. [5] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1682?utm_source=openai))
- Immigration misrepresentation ground: 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(C)(i) renders inadmissible any alien who seeks to procure a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact. [14] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182?utm_source=openai))

Context: Title IX litigation in 2024–2025 that EO 14201 cites or builds on
- 2024 Title IX rule vacatur: On January 9, 2025, the Eastern District of Kentucky vacated the 2024 Title IX rule nationwide in State of Tennessee v. Cardona, holding the rule unlawful and contrary to Title IX and other legal constraints. [6][7] ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/605ed79a22633f4c791058994d8ed5de?utm_source=openai))
- Additional litigation threads: Courts in Kansas (Kansas v. U.S. Department of Education) also enjoined parts of the 2024 rule in 2024; subsequent procedural developments followed the 2025 change in administration. [8] ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/45705/?utm_source=openai))
- Supreme Court posture: In January 2026 arguments, multiple justices signaled skepticism of challenges to state laws restricting transgender girls/women from female sports categories, with decisions expected by summer 2026.

Federal implementation activity since EO 14201
- Department of Education (ED/OCR)
  - Returned to enforcing the 2020 Title IX rule (announced January 31, 2025) and issued follow‑up Dear Colleague guidance in early February 2025. [9] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-enforce-2020-title-ix-rule-protecting-women?utm_source=openai))
  - Launched directed Title IX investigations into specific state high school associations and institutions for announced noncompliance regarding women’s sports participation. [10][11][21] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-launches-title-ix-investigations-two-athletic-associations?utm_source=openai))
- Department of Health and Human Services (HHS/OCR)
  - Opened a compliance review of Maine’s education authorities for stated refusal to comply with the EO and Title IX policy. [12] ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/keeping-men-out-womens-sports.html))
- Department of Homeland Security/USCIS
  - Announced policy updates aligning athlete‑related immigration benefits with EO 14201 to prevent authorizing “male” athletes to compete in women’s sports via visa classifications. [13] ([uscis.gov](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-updating-policy-to-protect-womens-sports?utm_source=openai))
- Cross-cutting definitions from EO 14168
  - EO 14168 (Jan. 20, 2025) provides controlling definitions of “sex,” “male,” and “female” for executive-branch policy application; published in the Federal Register on Jan. 30, 2025. [18][19] ([govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-30/html/2025-02090.htm?utm_source=openai))

Non-governmental sports governance responses (selected)
- NCAA: On February 6, 2025, the NCAA announced a policy restricting competition in women’s sports to student‑athletes assigned female at birth, referencing alignment with the new federal direction; practice/benefit provisions are addressed separately. [15] ([ncaa.org](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/2/6/media-center-ncaa-announces-transgender-student-athlete-participation-policy-change.aspx?utm_source=openai))

How the order uses Title IX and where the legal limits are
- Funding leverage is real but procedurally bounded: Title IX permits termination or refusal of federal assistance only after notice, hearing, and findings, and even then only as to the program or part found noncompliant; agencies may also use “other means authorized by law.” This constrains across‑the‑board defunding without case‑specific process. [5] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1682?utm_source=openai))
- “Vacatur” backdrop: Because the 2024 Title IX rule was vacated nationwide, ED’s reversion to the 2020 regulatory framework and targeted enforcement on sex-based categories is consistent with existing court orders noted in EO 14201 Section 3. [1][6][7][9] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Immigration provisions: Section 4(c) relies on existing misrepresentation authorities (8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(C)(i)); implementing agencies will still have to apply individualized admissibility determinations and existing waiver frameworks where applicable. [1][14] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Observed and likely impacts
- K‑12 and higher education: Rapid compliance reviews and investigations increase pressure on schools and athletic associations to structure women’s sports as sex‑based categories to avoid enforcement actions and potential targeted funding consequences. [9][10][11][12] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-enforce-2020-title-ix-rule-protecting-women?utm_source=openai))
- National sport governance: The NCAA’s policy change creates a national baseline for member institutions’ women’s competition, reducing sport‑by‑sport variation that existed pre‑2025. [15] ([ncaa.org](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/2/6/media-center-ncaa-announces-transgender-student-athlete-participation-policy-change.aspx?utm_source=openai))
- International/visa issues: The directive to State and DHS to review entry policies for “males seeking to participate in women’s sports” may affect athlete visas surrounding international competitions in the U.S. (for example, pre‑LA28), with determinations governed by the INA’s fraud/misrepresentation provisions. [1][14] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Litigation trajectory: With the Supreme Court appearing receptive to state‑level bans and lower‑court vacatur of the 2024 rule, agencies face a comparatively favorable environment to pursue sex‑based eligibility enforcement under Title IX, though institution‑specific proceedings must still satisfy statutory due‑process requirements under §1682. [5][16][17] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1682?utm_source=openai))

Open questions to monitor
- Supreme Court rulings in the Idaho and West Virginia cases and how the opinions treat Title IX, equal‑protection claims, and athletic eligibility distinctions. [16][17] ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/a0e50014fbf7f3ef5b1d1e9b5e8b662d?utm_source=openai))
- The scope and pace of ED/OCR enforcement—how often terminations or refusals of funds progress through the full §1682 hearing process versus informal resolution. [5][9][10][11][12] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1682?utm_source=openai))
- The extent to which immigration-screening changes materially affect athlete entries and whether guidance triggers litigation under the INA or the Administrative Procedure Act.
