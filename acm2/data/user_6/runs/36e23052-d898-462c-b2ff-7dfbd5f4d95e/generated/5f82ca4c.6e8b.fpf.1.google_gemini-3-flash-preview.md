**Research Report: Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports**

### **Executive Summary**
On February 5, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed **Executive Order 14201**, titled "**Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports**" [1], [2]. The order establishes a federal policy that defines sex-based protections in athletics according to biological sex assigned at birth, effectively prohibiting transgender women and girls from participating in female sports at all educational levels [1], [4]. The order leverages the "power of the purse" by directing federal agencies to rescind funding from educational institutions that permit transgender athletes to compete in women's categories [3], [6].

### **1. Purpose and Policy Objectives**
The stated purpose of Executive Order 14201 is to "protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports" [1], [10]. The administration asserts that allowing biological males to compete in female categories is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" and deprives women of equal opportunities under **Title IX** of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 [1], [10].

Key policy goals include:
*   **Safety and Privacy:** Prioritizing the protection of all-female locker rooms and athletic environments [3], [10].
*   **Fairness:** Ensuring that athletic opportunities and accolades (such as podium placements) are reserved for biological females [1], [16].
*   **Biological Standard:** Establishing a uniform national standard based on biological sex to resolve conflicting state laws and court decisions [2], [16].

---

### **2. Definitions and Legal Framework**
Executive Order 14201 does not independently define "sex." Instead, it explicitly adopts the definitions established in **Executive Order 14168** ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"), signed on January 20, 2025 [1], [3]. 
*   **Sex:** Defined as an "immutable biological classification" determined at the time of conception or birth [3], [5].
*   **Male and Female:** Defined based on reproductive biology (e.g., the size of reproductive cells produced) [8].
*   **Title IX Interpretation:** The order directs the Department of Education to interpret Title IX as a protection for biological females, rather than a protection against discrimination based on gender identity [1], [7].

---

### **3. Key Provisions and Directives**
The order issues specific mandates to several federal departments:

*   **Department of Education:** Must take immediate action to rescind federal funding from K-12 and post-secondary institutions that allow transgender women to play on girls' or women's teams [1], [2]. It is also directed to prioritize enforcement actions against institutions that require female students to share locker rooms with or compete against males [10], [13].
*   **Department of Justice:** Directed to provide resources to ensure "expeditious enforcement" and to convene State Attorneys General to identify best practices for enforcing these policies [10], [14].
*   **Department of State:** Tasked with promoting these biological standards internationally, specifically at the **United Nations** and the **International Olympic Committee (IOC)** [1], [17].
*   **Immigration and Border Security:** The State Department and DHS are directed to review policies and issue guidance to prevent transgender women from entering the United States for the purpose of participating in women's sports [6], [16]. This includes marking certain visa files with the code "**SWS25**" for tracking purposes [2].

### **4. Immediate Impact and Implementation**
*   **NCAA Response:** On February 6, 2025, one day after the order was signed, the **NCAA** revised its participation policy. The organization now limits women's sports competitions to athletes assigned female at birth to remain in compliance with the federal mandate and avoid the loss of federal funding [2], [4].
*   **Federal Funding:** The administration immediately began reviewing the athletics policies of universities. Investigations into specific institutions, such as San Jose State University, were initiated shortly after the order's signing [1], [5].

---

### **5. Legal Challenges and Controversy**
The order has faced immediate legal and social opposition:
*   **Litigation:** On February 12, 2025, two transgender students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that EO 14201 violates the **Equal Protection Clause** of the Constitution and the established interpretation of Title IX [1], [2].
*   **Title IX Conflicts:** Legal experts note a conflict between this order and the 2020 Supreme Court ruling in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, which held that discrimination based on gender identity is inherently a form of sex discrimination [1].
*   **State-Level Conflicts:** In states like California, which have laws protecting transgender athletes, educational institutions face a "preemption" crisis: complying with the federal EO could violate state law, while following state law risks the loss of federal funding [5].
