## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports – A Detailed Research Report

**Executive Order 14201**, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025. This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports at all educational levels and establish policies to ensure that athletic opportunities for women and girls are protected based on biological sex.

### Policy and Purpose

The executive order declares it the policy of the United States to protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports. It asserts that allowing men to compete in women's sports is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, denying them equal opportunity to participate and excel. The order cites Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, stating that educational institutions receiving federal funds cannot deny women an equal opportunity in sports. It further argues that "ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities".

A core policy established by Executive Order 14201 is to rescind federal funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities by allowing male competitive participation in women's sports. The order emphasizes opposing male competitive participation in women's sports more broadly, citing safety, fairness, dignity, and truth as guiding principles.

### Definitions

Executive Order 14201 adopts the definitions established in Executive Order 14168 of January 20, 2025, titled "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government". Executive Order 14168 defines "sex" as an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female, explicitly stating that "sex" is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of "gender identity". This strict biological interpretation of sex is foundational to Executive Order 14201.

### Key Provisions and Enforcement

The executive order outlines several directives for federal agencies:

*   **Department of Education Actions**: The Secretary of Education is directed to comply with the recent nationwide vacatur of 2024 regulations that expanded Title IX protections to include gender identity. The Secretary must also prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions and athletic associations that deny female students equal opportunity in sports by requiring them to compete with or against, or appear unclothed before, males in the women's category.
*   **Funding Rescission**: All executive departments and agencies are mandated to review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding from programs that do not comply with the order's policy.
*   **Department of Justice Support**: The Department of Justice is instructed to provide necessary resources to relevant agencies to ensure expeditious enforcement of the policy. This includes convening State Attorneys General to identify best practices for defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women in sports and educating them about instances where women and girls have been harmed by male participation in women's sports.
*   **International Diplomacy**: The Secretary of State is directed to use all appropriate measures to ensure the International Olympic Committee amends its standards to promote fairness, safety, and the best interests of female athletes by determining eligibility for women's sporting events based on sex, not gender identity or testosterone reduction. The order also rescinds U.S. support for international sports exchanges where female sports categories are based on identity rather than sex.

### Outcomes and Reactions

Following the signing of Executive Order 14201, the Department of Education immediately began reviewing athletic policies of universities and athletic associations that supported the participation of transgender women and girls in female sports for potential Title IX violations. The Trump administration has since escalated investigations into schools and colleges across the nation for policies allowing sports participation based on gender identity, asserting these violate the civil rights of female athletes under Title IX.

The NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) revised its transgender student-athlete participation policy following the executive order. The new NCAA policy limits competition in women's sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth. Student-athletes assigned male at birth may practice with women's teams and receive benefits, but cannot compete. The NCAA President, Charlie Baker, stated that the organization would comply with the executive order, praising it for providing a "clear, national standard" compared to conflicting state laws.

The State Department also announced a ban on transgender athletes from entering the United States if they intend to compete in women's sports, and visa applicants listing a gender other than their assigned sex may face permanent bans for "fraud".

### Legal Challenges

At least one legal challenge has emerged in response to Executive Order 14201. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 discriminate against transgender individuals in violation of the Constitution and Title IX. These challenges are expected to reference the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in *Bostock v. Clayton County* (2020), which found that discrimination based on gender identity inherently involves discrimination based on sex under Title VII. Plaintiffs in such cases seek declaratory judgment that the executive order is unconstitutional and unlawful, as well as permanent injunctions and nominal damages.
