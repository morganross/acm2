## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports – A Detailed Research Report

Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025, and subsequently published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025. This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports across all educational levels in the United States.

### Background and Context

The executive order builds upon and adopts the strict biological interpretation of "sex" previously established in Executive Order 14168, "Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government," signed on January 20, 2025. Executive Order 14168 defined "sex" as an "immutable biological classification" of "male" and "female," specifically referring to an individual's gender at conception.

The stated policy and purpose of Executive Order 14201 are to protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports. The order asserts that allowing "men to compete in women's sports" is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" to women and girls, and denies them equal athletic opportunity. It claims that some educational institutions and athletic associations have permitted this situation, thereby violating Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.

### Key Provisions

Executive Order 14201 outlines several directives to achieve its stated goals:
*   **Rescinding Federal Funding:** It establishes a policy to rescind all funds from educational programs that are found to "deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities" by allowing individuals identified as male to compete in women's sports. This is based on the premise that such actions endanger, humiliate, silence, and deprive women and girls of privacy.
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The order mandates the Secretary of Education to promptly enforce Title IX to "affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms". This includes drafting regulations and policy guidance to clearly specify that women's sports are reserved for women. The Secretary is also directed to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions against educational institutions and athletic associations that require female students to compete with or against males, or to appear unclothed before males, in women's categories.
*   **Department of Justice Support:** The Department of Justice is directed to provide necessary resources to relevant agencies to ensure the expeditious enforcement of the order's policy.
*   **Interagency Directives:**
    *   All executive departments and agencies are instructed to review grants to educational programs and rescind funding to those that do not comply with the executive order.
    *   The Domestic Policy Council is tasked with convening State Attorneys General to identify best practices for defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women in sports and to collect stories of women harmed by male participation.
    *   The Secretary of State is directed to use appropriate measures to encourage the International Olympic Committee to amend its standards for Olympic sporting events to ensure eligibility for women's events is determined by sex, not gender identity or testosterone reduction. The Secretary of State is also to rescind support for sports exchanges where female participation is based on gender identity rather than sex.
    *   The Department of Homeland Security is to review visa policies to address situations where males might falsely claim to be female to enter the U.S. to compete in women's sports.
*   **Vacatur of 2024 Regulations:** The order directs the Secretary of Education to continue complying with the nationwide vacatur of 2024 Title IX regulations that expanded protections to include gender identity, and to take action to ensure these regulations do not have effect.

### Impact and Reactions

The signing of Executive Order 14201 was followed by immediate actions and reactions:
*   **NCAA Policy Change:** Shortly after the order, the NCAA revised its participation policy for transgender student-athletes on February 6, 2025, limiting college competitions in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth, effective immediately. NCAA President Charlie Baker praised the executive order for providing a "clear, national standard".
*   **Legal Challenges:** The executive order has faced legal challenges. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 violate the Constitution and Title IX by discriminating against transgender individuals. These challenges are expected to reference the U.S. Supreme Court's 2020 decision in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, which found that workplace discrimination based on gender identity constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII.
*   **Department of Education Review:** The Department of Education immediately began reviewing the athletics policies of universities and athletic associations that supported the participation of transgender women and girls in female sports for potential Title IX violations.
*   **Congressional Legislation:** In January 2025, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" of 2025, which aims to amend Title IX to restrict transgender students from playing on women's sports teams by defining sex based solely on reproductive biology and genetics at birth.
*   **Socioeconomic Impact:** Analysis by some organizations suggests that the executive order's enforcement could disproportionately affect transgender women and girls of color, potentially exacerbating existing disparities in access to educational and athletic opportunities.

### Conclusion

Executive Order 14201 establishes a federal policy aimed at excluding transgender women and girls from women's and girls' sports based on a biological definition of sex. It directs federal agencies to enforce this policy through measures such as rescinding federal funding from non-compliant educational programs and prioritizing Title IX enforcement actions. The order has prompted changes in athletic association policies and has become the subject of legal challenges, reflecting ongoing debates about sex, gender identity, and equal opportunity in sports.
