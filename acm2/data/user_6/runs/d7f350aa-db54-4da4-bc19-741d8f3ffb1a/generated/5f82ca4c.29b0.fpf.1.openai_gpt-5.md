Executive summary
- On February 5, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports. The order was published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025 (FR Doc. 2025-02513). It asserts a federal policy to “rescind all funds” from educational programs that allow “male competitive participation in women’s sports,” ties enforcement to Title IX, and directs several agencies (Education, Justice, State, Homeland Security) to take specified actions. [1][2][3] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- The order relies on the administration’s earlier Executive Order 14168 (January 20, 2025) for definitions of “male” and “female,” and it cites litigation that vacated the 2024 Title IX rule, signaling a return to pre-2024 Title IX enforcement. [2][4][8][9] ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/keeping-men-out-of-womens-sports/))

What Executive Order 14201 does (text and structure)
- Policy and purpose (Sec. 1): Declares it “demeaning, unfair, and dangerous” for “men to compete in women’s sports”; states the U.S. will rescind funding from programs that deny “fair athletic opportunities” to women and girls; and frames the initiative as enforcement of Title IX. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Definitions (Sec. 2): Incorporates definitions from Executive Order 14168, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” [1][2][4] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Education-focused enforcement (Sec. 3): Directs the Secretary of Education to (a) “comply with the vacatur” of the April 29, 2024 Title IX rule, (b) “affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms,” (c) prioritize Title IX enforcement against institutions that require women “to compete with or against or to appear unclothed before males,” and (d) have agencies review grants and “rescind funding” to noncompliant programs. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Sports-governance and international dimension (Sec. 4): Orders the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy to convene athletic organizations and state attorneys general; directs the State Department to withdraw support for programs using gender identity-based categories, to promote sex-based female categories internationally and at the UN; instructs State and DHS to review visa/admission policies for “males seeking to participate in women’s sports”; and calls for pressing the IOC to adopt sex-based eligibility. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- General provisions (Sec. 5): Standard implementation clauses on consistency with law, no private right of action created, and severability. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Legal authority and enforcement framework the order relies on
- Title IX statutory mechanism: 20 U.S.C. § 1682 authorizes federal agencies to effectuate Title IX via rules and to enforce compliance, including by terminating or refusing funds after notice, an opportunity for hearing, and a 30‑day congressional reporting period—measures the Supreme Court has characterized as a “last resort.” [5][7] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1682?utm_source=openai))
- Implementing procedures: Education’s Title VI/IX enforcement regulations (e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 100.8, applied in Title IX by cross-reference) require attempts at voluntary compliance, formal findings after a hearing, agency-head approval, and congressional notice before fund termination. [6][7] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/100.8?utm_source=openai))
- OCR enforcement posture post‑vacatur: The Department of Education states that, after a January 9, 2025 decision, the 2024 Title IX rule is vacated and the 2020 rule is now in effect for OCR enforcement. EO 14201 explicitly references compliance with that vacatur. [8][1][2] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-offices/ocr/regulations-enforced-by-the-office-for-civil-rights?utm_source=openai))

Key litigation context cited or implicated by EO 14201
- Tennessee v. Cardona (E.D. Ky. Jan. 9, 2025): The court vacated the 2024 Title IX Final Rule nationwide as contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. The opinion is central to the order’s Section 3 directive. [9] ([jdsupra.com](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/title-ix-final-rule-vacated-nationwide-3500998/?utm_source=openai))
- Kansas v. U.S. Department of Education (D. Kan. 2024–25): Separate litigation challenging the 2024 Title IX rule; the court issued a preliminary injunction in July 2024, and later proceedings reflect the shifting landscape post‑vacatur. [10] ([clearinghouse.net](https://clearinghouse.net/case/45705/?utm_source=openai))
- Pending Supreme Court review (2026 term): The Court heard arguments January 13, 2026 in cases testing state bans on transgender girls/women in school sports (Idaho and West Virginia). Early reporting describes a skeptical posture toward challenges to those bans; decisions expected later in 2026 may shape how states and schools reconcile EO 14201, Title IX, and state laws. [16][17] ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/13/supreme-court-transgender-athletes-state-bans/?utm_source=openai))

What has happened since the order (implementation signals and early responses)
- Federal Register and White House posting: The text is official and identical across the White House Presidential Actions page and the Federal Register publication on February 11, 2025. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Department of Education enforcement: ED’s Office for Civil Rights announced (Feb. 6, 2025) investigations “pursuant to” the executive order into specific institutions and an athletic association, signaling immediate Title IX investigations in athletics. [11] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-investigate-title-ix-violations-athletics))
- NCAA: On February 6, 2025, the NCAA Board of Governors adopted a new participation policy limiting competition in women’s sports to student‑athletes “assigned female at birth,” expressly noting the executive order and aiming for a uniform national standard. NCAA also issued the same-day presidential statement foreshadowing alignment. [12][13] ([ncaa.org](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/2/6/media-center-ncaa-announces-transgender-student-athlete-participation-policy-change.aspx))
- U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee: The USOPC’s transgender participation page now refers readers to the Athlete Safety Policy as of July 21, 2025; syndicated AP coverage reports a policy change emphasizing compliance with federal expectations and referencing the executive order. [14][15] ([usopc.org](https://www.usopc.org/diversity-equity-inclusion/transgender-athlete-participation-in-sport?utm_source=openai))

How EO 14201 would be enforced in practice (what schools and agencies must navigate)
- Agency playbook under Title IX: Before funding can be terminated, an agency must (1) give notice of noncompliance and seek voluntary compliance; (2) provide a hearing and make an on‑the‑record finding; (3) secure agency‑head approval; and (4) file a report to the relevant congressional committees and wait 30 days. Agencies may also refer matters to DOJ. These steps apply across Title VI/Title IX enforcement. [5][6][7] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1682?utm_source=openai))
- OCR complaint process: OCR evaluates complaints for jurisdiction, timeliness, and sufficiency; opens investigations by letter; seeks voluntary resolution agreements; and, if necessary, proceeds to formal enforcement or DOJ referral. [18][19] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaints-how.html?utm_source=openai))

Points of legal vulnerability and likely areas of challenge
- Substantive constraints: While EO 14201 can set executive policy, it cannot amend Title IX; durable changes generally require regulations under the APA or congressional action. Agencies still must follow the statutory and regulatory preconditions to terminate funds (notice, hearing, findings, congressional notice). [5][6][7] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1682?utm_source=openai))
- Potential claims: Critics may argue that shifting Title IX enforcement to a categorical, sex‑assigned‑at‑birth standard via executive direction exceeds statutory authority or is arbitrary under the APA if applied through nonrule guidance; others may raise Spending Clause or constitutional claims if enforcement conditions are viewed as coercive or ambiguous. (For background on Title VI/IX enforcement tools and constraints, see CRS.) [7] ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11316?utm_source=openai))
- Conflicts with state law and athletic bodies: The order’s policy could conflict with inclusive state laws or existing sport‑by‑sport eligibility standards. The Supreme Court’s forthcoming decisions on state sports bans will influence how federal enforcement interacts with state frameworks. [16][17] ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/13/supreme-court-transgender-athletes-state-bans/?utm_source=openai))

International and immigration directives in the order
- IOC and international standards: The State Department is directed to “use all appropriate and available measures” urging the IOC to base women’s eligibility on sex rather than gender identity or testosterone thresholds, and to withdraw U.S. support from exchanges where women’s categories are identity‑based. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))
- Visa and entry screening: State and DHS are instructed to review and adjust policies limiting entry of “males seeking to participate in women’s sports,” referencing INA § 212(a)(6)(C)(i) on misrepresentation. Implementation would still be subject to existing immigration law. [1][2] ([federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/full_text/html/2025/02/11/2025-02513.html))

Practical implications for covered entities
- K‑12 school districts, colleges, and associations receiving federal funds:
  - Reassess athletics eligibility, facilities, and locker‑room policies for alignment with the order’s stated policy and current federal enforcement posture (2020 Title IX rule in effect). [8][1][2] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/ed-offices/ocr/regulations-enforced-by-the-office-for-civil-rights?utm_source=openai))
  - Prepare for OCR inquiries or directed investigations regarding athletics participation policies; ensure documentation and Title IX compliance processes are robust. [11][18][19] ([ed.gov](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-investigate-title-ix-violations-athletics))
  - Understand the formal prerequisites before any fund termination and opportunities for voluntary resolution. [5][6][7] ([law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1682?utm_source=openai))
- Athletic governing bodies (NCAA/USOPC/NGBs):
  - NCAA has already adopted a policy restricting women’s competition to those assigned female at birth, effective immediately; schools remain subject to federal, state, and local laws. [12] ([ncaa.org](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/2/6/media-center-ncaa-announces-transgender-student-athlete-participation-policy-change.aspx))
  - USOPC communications and media coverage indicate alignment via policy updates tied to athlete safety and federal compliance expectations. [14][15] ([usopc.org](https://www.usopc.org/diversity-equity-inclusion/transgender-athlete-participation-in-sport?utm_source=openai))

Notes on scope and limits
- EO 14201 is an executive policy directive. Title IX enforcement against schools and associations that receive federal funding must still follow statutory and regulatory procedures for findings and any fund terminations. The order’s calls to influence the IOC and international bodies do not themselves change IOC rules; they instruct diplomatic and convening actions.
