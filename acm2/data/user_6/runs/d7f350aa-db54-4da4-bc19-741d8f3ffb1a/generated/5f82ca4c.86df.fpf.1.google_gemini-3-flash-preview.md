**Executive Order 14201**, titled **"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,"** was signed by President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025 [1.1][1.3]. This order is a central component of the administration’s broader policy initiative to redefine sex-based protections within the federal government, specifically targeting the participation of transgender women and girls in female athletics [1.2][1.6].

### **1. Policy and Purpose**
The stated purpose of Executive Order 14201 is to "protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports" [1.2]. The order asserts that allowing transgender women (referred to in the text as "men") to compete in women's categories is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" and constitutes a violation of the original intent of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [1.2][1.11]. 

The policy establishes that:
*   **Biological Basis:** It adopts the definitions of "sex," "male," and "female" from **Executive Order 14168** ("Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism"), which defines sex as an immutable biological classification based on reproductive biology and genetics at birth [1.2][1.16].
*   **Title IX Interpretation:** It mandates that Title IX be interpreted to prohibit the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports [1.11][1.14].
*   **Locker Room Privacy:** The order directs agencies to "affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms," requiring sex-segregated facilities based on biological sex [1.5][1.13].

### **2. Key Provisions and Enforcement**
The executive order utilizes the power of federal funding and administrative oversight to enforce its mandates across several sectors:

*   **Rescission of Federal Funding:** The order directs the Secretary of Education to rescind federal funds from any elementary, secondary, or post-secondary institution that allows transgender women to compete on female sports teams [1.1][1.2].
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Department of Education is instructed to prioritize enforcement actions against educational institutions and athletic associations that do not comply with the new sex-based standards [1.5][1.6].
*   **Visa and Immigration Restrictions:** The order directs the State Department and Department of Homeland Security to adjust policies to prevent transgender female athletes from entering the United States to compete in women's sports [1.6]. Visa applicants suspected of such intentions may have their files marked with the tracking code **"SWS25"** (Save Women's Sports 25) [1.1].
*   **International Advocacy:** The United States is directed to use its influence to encourage international bodies, such as the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), to adopt eligibility standards based on biological sex rather than gender identity or testosterone levels [1.6][1.8].

### **3. Impact on Athletic Organizations**
The issuance of EO 14201 prompted immediate changes within major sports governing bodies:
*   **NCAA Policy Change:** On February 6, 2025, one day after the order was signed, the NCAA changed its policy to limit college competitions in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth [1.1]. NCAA President Charlie Baker noted that the order provided a "clear, national standard" [1.1].
*   **Record Revision:** The Department of Education urged high school and college athletic organizations (including the NFHS) to revoke records held by transgender female athletes and restore those of cisgender female competitors [1.1].

### **4. Legal Challenges and Controversy**
Executive Order 14201 has faced significant legal and social pushback:
*   **Litigation:** On February 12, 2025, a lawsuit was filed in New Hampshire by transgender high school students (e.g., *Parker Tirrell and Iris Turmelle v. Trump*), alleging that the order violates the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection clause and exceeds presidential authority under Title IX [1.3][1.13].
*   **Supreme Court Context:** The order's legality is often discussed in relation to *Bostock v. Clayton County*, which found that discrimination based on gender identity is a form of sex discrimination, and current cases like *West Virginia v. B.P.J.* [1.3][1.18].
*   **Sanctuary Cities:** In response to this and related orders, some municipalities, such as Worcester, Massachusetts, voted to become "transgender sanctuary cities," committing to refuse cooperation with federal entities infringing on transgender rights [1.3].
