# Research Report: Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports

**Executive Summary**
Executive Order 14201, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025 [1][2]. The order establishes a federal policy that defines eligibility for female sports categories strictly based on biological sex assigned at birth [1]. It mandates that educational institutions receiving federal funding must reserve women’s and girls' sports for biological females or risk the rescission of federal funds under Title IX [2][3].

### 1. Policy and Purpose
The stated purpose of EO 14201 is to "protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports" [1][4]. The administration argues that allowing transgender women (referred to in the order as "men") to compete in female categories is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" and deprives biological women of equal opportunities [4][5]. The order asserts that ignoring biological differences denies women meaningful access to educational facilities, citing recent federal court cases such as *Tennessee v. Cardona* [4].

### 2. Key Definitions and Biological Framework
EO 14201 does not independently define "male" and "female" but instead incorporates the definitions established in **Executive Order 14168**, "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government" [1][4]. Under this framework:
*   **Sex** is defined as an "immutable biological classification" determined at birth [2].
*   **Female** refers to individuals whose reproductive biology and genetics at birth are female [1].

### 3. Mandates for Federal Agencies
The order directs several cabinet-level departments to take immediate action:
*   **Department of Education:** The Secretary of Education is ordered to prioritize Title IX enforcement against institutions that allow transgender women to compete in female sports or share locker rooms with biological women [2][4]. The department is also directed to ensure 2024 regulations expanding Title IX to include gender identity remain vacated or ineffective [2].
*   **Department of State:** The Secretary of State is tasked with promoting these sex-based standards at the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) [3][5]. Additionally, the State Department and Department of Homeland Security must review policies regarding international travel for transgender athletes coming to the U.S. for sports competitions [3].
*   **Department of Justice:** The DOJ is directed to provide resources to agencies for the "expeditious enforcement" of the policy [5].

### 4. Implementation and Funding Rescission
A central mechanism of EO 14201 is the threat of financial penalties. All executive departments and agencies are required to review grants to educational programs and rescind funding for those that fail to comply with the mandate [2][3]. This applies to elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions [1].

### 5. Institutional and Legal Impact
*   **NCAA Response:** Following the order, the NCAA changed its policy in February 2025 to limit women's sports competitions to athletes assigned female at birth, effective immediately [1].
*   **Legal Challenges:** The order has faced immediate litigation. On February 12, 2025, a lawsuit was filed in New Hampshire (*Tirrell v. Trump*) by transgender students alleging that the order violates the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection rights and Title IX [2][6].
*   **State Conflicts:** The order has created significant tension in states like California, where state laws explicitly protect the rights of transgender athletes to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity [2].
