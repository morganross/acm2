## Executive Order 14187: Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation

**Executive Summary:**

Executive Order 14187, titled "Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation," was issued by Donald Trump on January 28, 2025. The order aims to prevent gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 years old by withholding federal funding and directing various agencies to restrict access to related treatments, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and certain surgeries. The Executive Order frames gender-affirming care for minors as "chemical and surgical mutilation," "maiming," and "sterilizing," asserting that such interventions lead to regret and lifelong medical complications. It explicitly states that the U.S. Federal Government will not "fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another".

This executive action has sparked significant controversy and legal challenges. Proponents argue the order protects vulnerable children from irreversible procedures based on what they consider "junk science" from organizations like the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). Conversely, major medical associations in the U.S., including the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Academy of Nursing, support gender-affirming care for minors as evidence-based and medically necessary, opposing legislative interference in patient-provider relationships. Critics, including civil rights groups and several states, have filed lawsuits, leading to federal judges issuing nationwide preliminary injunctions that have temporarily blocked the enforcement of key provisions of the order, particularly those related to withholding federal funds. As of March 2025, the order's enforceability remains largely stalled due to ongoing litigation, though some hospitals initially paused care out of fear of repercussions. The order reflects a broader national trend of increasing state-level restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors, many of which are also facing legal challenges.

### 1. Introduction to Executive Order 14187

Executive Order 14187, "Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation," was signed by President Donald Trump on January 28, 2025. The order declares that it is U.S. policy not to "fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another," and mandates rigorous enforcement of laws prohibiting or limiting what it describes as "destructive and life-altering procedures". A "child" is defined in the order as an individual under 19 years of age. The stated purpose of the order is to address the practice of medical professionals "maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children" through irreversible medical interventions, which the order asserts will lead to regret, inability to conceive children, and lifelong medical complications. The White House report supporting the EO specifically claims that during the prior administration, over 7,000 children received puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and more than 4,000 underwent sex-trait modification surgeries like mastectomies, which it characterizes as being promoted by "ideologically driven and financially motivated junk-science".

The Executive Order's provisions include:
*   Directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review insurance terms under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act to end certain types of gender-affirming care.
*   Ordering federal agencies that provide grants to medical institutions to ensure these institutions cease offering gender-affirming care to minors.
*   Excluding coverage of gender-affirming care for minors from TRICARE, the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, and the Postal Services Health Benefits program.
*   Protecting whistleblowers who report institutions allegedly violating the executive order by providing gender-affirming care.
*   Directing agencies to rescind or amend policies relying on the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) "Standards of Care Version 8," which the order dismisses as "junk science".

### 2. Context: Gender-Affirming Care for Minors

Gender-affirming care (GAC) for minors encompasses a range of medical and mental health services designed to support individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth. This care is described by medical organizations as holistic, patient-centered, and interdisciplinary, based on decades of research and expert consensus. It may include social transition, puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and, in some cases, surgical interventions, with specific age restrictions for different treatments. The American Academy of Nursing and the American Medical Association (AMA) consider GAC medically necessary and essential for the physical and mental well-being of transgender and gender-diverse youth.

Puberty blockers (GnRH agonists) are reversible medications used to delay the onset of puberty, providing adolescents more time to explore their gender identity before developing secondary sex characteristics. Hormone therapy, such as estrogen or testosterone, can induce physical changes to align with an individual's gender identity and is generally initiated later in adolescence. Surgical interventions for gender affirmation in minors are typically limited, with procedures like mastectomy for transmasculine youth sometimes occurring in late adolescence, while genital surgeries are generally reserved for adulthood.

A consensus of major U.S. medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the American Psychiatric Association, support evidence-based gender-affirming care for transgender youth. These organizations emphasize that medical decisions should be made by patients, their families, and healthcare providers, not by politicians.

### 3. Contested Terminology: "Chemical and Surgical Mutilation"

The Executive Order 14187 explicitly defines "chemical and surgical mutilation" to include the use of puberty blockers, sex hormones to align physical appearance with a different identity, and surgical procedures that attempt to transform appearance or alter sexual organs to minimize or destroy natural biological functions. The order further states that this phrase "sometimes is referred to as 'gender affirming care'". The White House report frames gender-affirming care for minors as a "grotesque social and scientific experiment" leading to "chemical sterilization and surgical mutilation".

This terminology is a central point of contention. Medical and LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations strongly oppose the characterization of gender-affirming care as "mutilation." They assert that these are medically indicated treatments, provided with informed consent and ongoing monitoring, that improve the health and well-being of transgender individuals. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and its U.S. affiliate (USPATH) vehemently oppose legislation banning access to gender-affirming care, stating that such efforts lack scientific merit and are based on "outdated and untrue" assumptions about transgender children and adolescents. They argue that denying or delaying access to indicated treatment can lead to devastating consequences for transgender youth. The American Academy of Nursing explicitly calls for the prohibition of policies and legislation that interfere with the patient-provider relationship and restrict access to gender-affirming care.

### 4. Arguments for the Executive Order

Proponents of Executive Order 14187 argue that it is necessary to protect children from irreversible medical procedures with potentially harmful long-term consequences. The order's text states that "countless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding". It also raises concerns about vulnerable youths being "trapped with lifelong medical complications" and rising medical bills.

The White House report further asserts that during the previous administration, "gender-affirming care" interventions were "marketed to children on the basis of ideologically driven and financially motivated junk-science". It specifically criticizes WPATH's "Standards of Care Version 8," claiming they "were not drafted based on scientific evidence, but on political considerations". The report alleges that a former Assistant Secretary for Health lobbied WPATH to remove proposed age limits for surgical procedures, and subsequently issued federal guidance promoting "chemical sterilization and surgical mutilation of minors". From this perspective, the order is presented as restoring "biological truth" to the federal government and safeguarding the binary nature of sex.

### 5. Arguments Against the Executive Order

Opponents of Executive Order 14187, including major medical organizations, civil rights groups, and several state governments, argue that the order interferes with evidence-based medical care and may harm transgender youth. They contend that gender-affirming care is medically necessary and supported by a consensus of U.S. medical associations. Organizations such as the American Academy of Nursing and the American Medical Association emphasize that medical decisions should be made by patients, their families, and healthcare providers, not by political directives.

Critics argue that the order's broad restrictions on federal funding threaten access to care for transgender youth, including those in Medicaid, Medicare, and military families. They highlight that the order redefines gender-affirming care using "harmful and inaccurate terms" like "chemical and surgical mutilation" and directs agencies to disregard established guidelines from experts in the field. The argument is made that such actions can increase risk for both providers and recipients of care, and may lead to worse health outcomes for transgender individuals. Furthermore, lawsuits challenging the EO assert that it exceeds presidential authority, infringes on congressional powers, and discriminates based on transgender status and sex, violating the separation of powers and the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection clause.

### 6. Impact and Implications

Executive Order 14187 seeks to significantly restrict access to gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 by leveraging federal funding and regulatory power. This could impact hospitals, clinics, schools, and community-based organizations that rely on federal grants and provide such care. However, the immediate enforceability of the EO has been largely halted due to legal challenges.

**Legal Challenges and Injunctions:**
Multiple groups, including the ACLU, Lambda Legal, PFLAG, and GLMA, filed a lawsuit (PFLAG v. Trump) in Maryland. Separately, the attorneys general from Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, and Colorado, along with three doctors, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state. Both sets of plaintiffs challenged the EO on grounds that it is unconstitutional and unlawful.

In response to these lawsuits, federal judges have issued preliminary injunctions:
*   On February 13, 2025, Judge Brendan Hurson issued a temporary restraining order preventing the withholding of federal funds from hospitals providing gender-affirming care to minors. This injunction was extended to a nationwide block on March 4, 2025, by Judge Hurson.
*   On March 1, 2025, Judge Lauren King blocked the executive order, but this injunction was limited to the four states that filed the lawsuit: Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, and Colorado.

These injunctions mean that, as of early 2025, the federal government is temporarily prohibited from conditioning, withholding, or terminating funding from healthcare entities or professionals for providing gender-affirming care to patients under 19. While some hospitals initially paused gender-affirming care out of fear, some resumed after the injunctions were issued. Litigation is ongoing, and appeals are expected, meaning the long-term legal status of the EO remains uncertain.

**Broader Policy Landscape:**
Executive Order 14187 aligns with a broader trend of state-level legislative actions seeking to limit youth access to gender-affirming care. By January 2024, more than half of U.S. states had enacted laws or policies restricting access to GAC for minors, with 24 of these states imposing professional or legal penalties on healthcare practitioners. Many of these state laws are also being challenged in court. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2025 in *United States v. Skrmetti*, a case challenging a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care. The court found that the law did not constitute sex-based discrimination and did not violate the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause, potentially impacting the viability of other state bans and the federal executive order. However, some state bans, such as those in Montana and Arkansas, remain permanently enjoined based on state constitutional grounds or Due Process claims, indicating a complex and varied legal landscape.

### 7. Limitations and Uncertainties

Despite extensive research and ongoing litigation, several limitations and uncertainties surround Executive Order 14187 and its subject matter:
*   **Evolving Legal Landscape:** The enforceability of EO 14187 is currently subject to preliminary injunctions, with ongoing litigation and appeals. The final legal outcome and its scope (nationwide vs. state-specific) are uncertain and could significantly alter the impact of the order. The Supreme Court's ruling in *United States v. Skrmetti* on state-level bans may influence future challenges to the federal EO, but the specific implications are still being assessed.
*   **Data Scarcity and Contention:** The White House report cites figures of over 7,000 children receiving puberty blockers and hormones and over 4,000 undergoing sex-trait modification surgeries under the previous administration. However, detailed, independently verified, and comprehensive national data on the prevalence of specific gender-affirming medical interventions for minors, as well as long-term regret or detransition rates, from neutral sources is often contentious or limited. The order itself criticizes existing guidelines as "junk science" and directs HHS to conduct its own literature review, which critics suggest may be tailored to support the administration's policy goals.
*   **Lack of Uniform Medical Consensus on Age Limits:** While major medical organizations support gender-affirming care, specific guidelines regarding age limits for certain interventions (particularly surgical) can be nuanced and are subject to ongoing review and refinement within the medical community. The EO's blanket prohibition for under-19s differs from current medical standards that often involve individualized assessments.
*   **Potential for Chilling Effect:** Even with injunctions in place, the issuance of the Executive Order and the threat of enforcement or whistleblower protections may create a "chilling effect" among healthcare providers, leading some to pause or discontinue gender-affirming care for minors out of caution or fear of legal repercussions, regardless of the ultimate legal outcome.

### 8. Conclusions

Executive Order 14187 represents a significant federal attempt to restrict gender-affirming care for individuals under the age of 19, framing such medical interventions as "chemical and surgical mutilation". The order seeks to achieve this by withholding federal funding from institutions providing such care and directing federal agencies to cease support for gender transition in minors. The rationale presented by proponents centers on protecting children from irreversible procedures, potential regret, and long-term health complications, while also dismissing current medical guidelines as politically motivated "junk science".

However, the order is highly contested. Major U.S. medical associations broadly endorse gender-affirming care as evidence-based and medically necessary for transgender youth, asserting that medical decisions should remain between patients, their families, and healthcare providers. Critics also argue that the order oversteps presidential authority, infringes on congressional powers, and discriminates against transgender individuals.

The immediate impact of EO 14187 has been tempered by federal court injunctions, which have temporarily blocked key enforcement mechanisms, particularly the withholding of federal funds. While litigation is ongoing, these injunctions mean that the order is not currently enforceable nationwide in its entirety. Nevertheless, the order reflects a continuing and growing national debate, mirroring numerous state-level restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors, many of which are also subject to legal challenges. The landscape of gender-affirming care in the U.S. remains highly uncertain and legally complex, with the potential for further shifts depending on future court rulings and administrative actions.
