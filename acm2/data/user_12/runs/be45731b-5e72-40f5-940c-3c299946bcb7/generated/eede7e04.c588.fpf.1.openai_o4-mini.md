**Executive Summary**

Executive Order 14187, titled “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” was signed on January 28, 2025, by President Trump to prohibit federal support for gender-affirming medical interventions (puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries) for individuals under 19 and to direct executive agencies to rescind related guidance and enforce restrictions [1]. The order prompted immediate legal challenges, resulting in nationwide and multi-state preliminary injunctions that block its enforcement while litigation proceeds [2][3]. Hospitals nationwide paused pediatric gender-affirming care to avoid losing federal funding [2]. Scientific evidence indicates that fewer than 1 in 1,000 insured U.S. adolescents received puberty blockers or hormones from 2018–2022, underscoring the rarity of these interventions [5]. Major medical organizations—including the American Medical Association and the Endocrine Society—endorse gender-affirming care as evidence-based and ethically required, directly contrasting the order’s characterization of such care as “mutilation” [10][11]. Critics highlight that the World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s Standards of Care Version 8 rely on limited pediatric evidence and consensus expert opinion rather than robust randomized trials [7][8][9]. This report analyzes the policy, legal responses, medical evidence, stakeholder perspectives, and implications, concluding with actionable recommendations for policymakers, healthcare institutions, and researchers.

## 1. Background: Pediatric Gender-Affirming Care in the United States

• Gender-affirming care for minors encompasses psychosocial support, puberty blockers (e.g., GnRH agonists), gender-affirming hormones (estrogen, testosterone), and, in rare cases, chest or genital surgery, administered under multidisciplinary protocols involving mental health and medical specialists [1].

• Between 2018 and 2022, among over 5 million insured adolescents aged 8–17, only 926 received puberty blockers and 1,927 received hormone therapy; no patients under age 12 were prescribed hormones, demonstrating cautious clinical practice and low prevalence of interventions [5].

• As of early 2025, 26 states had enacted or proposed laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors; most are under legal challenge or enjoined [5].

## 2. Executive Order 14187: Key Provisions

• Policy and Purpose: Declares that federal agencies “will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” pediatric “chemical and surgical mutilation” and emphasizes irreversible harm, sterilization, and lifelong complications as purported outcomes [1].

• Definitions: Defines “children” as under 19, “chemical and surgical mutilation” to include puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and any procedures altering or removing sexual organs, sometimes referred to as “gender-affirming care” [1].

• Agency Directives:
  - Rescind or amend all policies relying on WPATH Standards of Care Version 8 and publish an HHS literature review within 90 days on best practices for gender-dysphoric youth [1].
  - Defund federal research and education grants to institutions providing pediatric gender-affirming care [1].
  - Amend Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and federal employee health benefits to exclude such treatments; direct DOJ to enforce laws against consumer deception and pursue legislation for a private right of action for affected families [1].

• Implementation Timeline: Agencies must report progress within 60 days; HHS must withdraw its March 2, 2022, guidance and issue new whistleblower protections; DoD and OPM must amend military and federal employee plans for the 2026 plan year [1].

## 3. Legal Challenges and Institutional Responses

• Nationwide Injunctions:  
  – On February 13, 2025, Judge Brendan Hurson (D. Md.) issued a nationwide temporary restraining order preventing enforcement of E.O. 14187’s funding restrictions against hospitals providing gender-affirming care to minors, later extended as a preliminary injunction [2].  
  – On February 14, 2025, Judge Lauren King (W.D. Wash.) blocked Section 4 of E.O. 14187 in Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, and Colorado, finding likely violations of equal protection and state sovereignty over Medicaid [3].

• Hospitals’ Reactions: Multiple federally funded institutions—including Children’s National Hospital (DC), NYU Langone, VCU Medical Center, and Children’s Hospital of Richmond—paused pediatric hormone and surgical services to assess compliance risks [2].

• Multi-State Litigation: Fifteen state attorneys general filed suit defending continuation of gender-affirming care, arguing the order unlawfully discriminates based on sex and medical necessity; the suits remain pending [3].

## 4. Evidence Base and Contested Science

• Rarity and Caution in Practice: The JAMA Pediatrics analysis of claims data confirms that gender-affirming medical interventions in minors are rare, with none under age 12 receiving hormones between 2018 and 2022, suggesting clinical caution and stringent protocols [5].

• HHS Review Report: An April 28, 2025 White House fact sheet reported over 7,000 minors received puberty blockers and 4,000 underwent surgical interventions in the first three years of the Biden administration, labeling these as “ideologically driven” and framing a need for policy reversal; however, methodology and data sources were not fully disclosed [6].

• WPATH Standards of Care Version 8:  
  – Developed via a multidisciplinary committee and systematic evidence reviews by Johns Hopkins University that acknowledged “little to no evidence about children and adolescents,” SOC8 relies heavily on expert consensus and observational studies [7][8].  
  – Critics note the absence of randomized controlled trials for pediatric interventions, small sample sizes (e.g., Dutch model n=55), and potential publication constraints, underscoring low to very low certainty in recommendations [8][9].

• Medical Organization Positions:
  – The American Medical Association opposes legislative restrictions, affirming that gender-affirming care is evidence-based, minimizes distress, and improves mental health via shared decision-making among patients, families, and clinicians [10].  
  – The Endocrine Society emphasizes a conservative, staged approach—psychosocial support first, medical interventions reserved for adolescents—citing studies that link puberty blockers to reduced suicidal ideation compared to those denied treatment [11].

## 5. Stakeholder Perspectives

• Supporters of E.O. 14187, including DOJ and conservative advocates, characterize gender-affirming care for minors as experimental and ideologically driven, advocating legislative remedies like the Victims of Chemical or Surgical Mutilation Act, which would create private rights of action against providers [12].

• LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, PFLAG, the ACLU, and major medical associations argue that the executive order undermines clinical standards, discriminates against transgender youth, and poses irreparable harm, framing the restrictions as political interference in medical practice [2][3][13].

• Divergent State Responses: While 15 AGs defend care continuity, at least 26 states have enacted moratoria or bans; Utah’s 2025 DHHS report—funded by state lawmakers—upheld substantial evidence supporting adolescent gender-affirming care, leading to legislative pushback despite its findings [14].

## 6. Limitations and Uncertainties

• Data Gaps: Long-term outcomes for minors receiving hormone therapy and surgery remain under-studied; high-quality randomized controlled trials are scarce, limiting certainty on benefits and risks [9].

• Potential Biases: WPATH’s reliance on self-commissioned reviews, reported publication constraints, and advocacy positions may introduce confirmation bias [8]; state-commissioned reports may reflect political agendas [14].

• Emerging Debates: Contestation around rapid-onset gender dysphoria and definitions of “best practices” reflect ongoing academic and clinical disputes, with no consensus on standard treatment protocols for all minors [15].

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

1. **Maintain Access Pending Evidence**: Federal agencies and courts should preserve current continuity of care for minors by respecting existing injunctions until robust, peer-reviewed evidence clarifies long-term outcomes.

2. **Commission Independent Research**: The Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, and AHRQ should fund large-scale, prospective studies and randomized trials on pediatric gender-affirming care to address evidence gaps.

3. **Update Clinical Guidance Transparently**: Convene an independent, multidisciplinary panel (including non-WPATH experts) to review pediatric gender-affirming care evidence, publish full methodologies, and establish clear age-appropriate protocols.

4. **Ensure Legal and Ethical Clarity**: Congress should consider legislation that balances protection of minors with medical autonomy, possibly via oversight committees rather than blanket funding bans.

5. **Monitor and Mitigate Harms**: Implement data-driven surveillance of pediatric patients receiving gender-affirming interventions to identify adverse events, patient satisfaction, and regret rates in real time.

6. **Facilitate Informed Consent**: Strengthen informed consent processes for minors and guardians, integrating findings from scoping reviews on youth decision-making capacity to ensure ethical standards [16].
