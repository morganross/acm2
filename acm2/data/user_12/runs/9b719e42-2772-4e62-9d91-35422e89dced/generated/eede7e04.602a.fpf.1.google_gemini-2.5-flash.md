## Executive Order 14187: Examining Federal Policy on Gender-Affirming Care for Minors

### Executive Summary

Executive Order (EO) 14187, titled "Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation," was issued by President Donald Trump on January 28, 2025. This order aims to significantly restrict access to gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 years old by prohibiting federal funding and directing various federal agencies to take actions against such practices. The EO defines "chemical and surgical mutilation" to include puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgical procedures intended to align a child's physical appearance with a gender identity different from their sex assigned at birth, characterizing these interventions as "destructive and life-altering" and stemming from "ideologically driven and financially motivated junk-science".

The order has faced immediate legal challenges, with federal judges issuing injunctions to block the government from withholding federal funds from healthcare providers offering gender-affirming care to minors. These legal battles continue, alongside a broader national debate on the ethics and efficacy of gender-affirming care for minors. While major U.S. medical associations, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics, affirm gender-affirming care as medically necessary and beneficial for mental health outcomes, the EO's proponents cite concerns about potential long-term harm, regret, infertility, and insufficient evidence for these treatments. The Department of Justice has also proposed legislation, the "Victims of Chemical or Surgical Mutilation Act (VCSMA)," in alignment with the EO, to further restrict such care and establish a private right of action.

### 1. Introduction: Context of Executive Order 14187

The debate surrounding gender-affirming care for minors in the United States intensified significantly in recent years, leading to diverse legislative and executive actions at both state and federal levels. Executive Order (EO) 14187, signed on January 28, 2025, by President Donald Trump, represents a pivotal federal intervention in this contentious area. The order frames its purpose as safeguarding children from irreversible medical procedures, asserting that "medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children". This action builds upon a trend seen in numerous states that have already enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors. The EO was issued amidst a broader set of executive orders in early 2025 targeting transgender rights in education, military service, and legal recognition, contributing to a climate of fear and anti-trans hostility.

### 2. Overview of Executive Order 14187

Executive Order 14187, titled "Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation," establishes a federal policy to prohibit support for what it terms the "transition" of a child from one sex to another. A "child" is defined as an individual under 19 years of age. The order broadly defines "chemical and surgical mutilation" to encompass several forms of gender-affirming care:
*   **Puberty blockers**: Including GnRH agonists and other interventions used to delay puberty in individuals not identifying with their sex assigned at birth.
*   **Sex hormones**: Such as androgen blockers, estrogen, progesterone, or testosterone, used to align physical appearance with a gender identity different from sex assigned at birth.
*   **Surgical procedures**: Any operations attempting to transform an individual's physical appearance or alter/remove sexual organs to minimize or destroy natural biological functions, when done to align with an identity differing from sex assigned at birth. This phrase is sometimes referred to as "gender affirming care" within the EO.

The EO directs federal departments and agencies to cease funding, sponsoring, promoting, assisting, or supporting these practices. Key directives include:
*   **Funding Withdrawal**: Prohibiting federal departments from funding such interventions and directing agencies to stop these practices "to the greatest extent possible". This includes federally-run insurance programs like TRICARE and Medicaid, which are instructed to exclude coverage for such care.
*   **DOJ Investigations**: The Department of Justice (DOJ) is directed to prioritize investigations and take action against states and pharmaceutical companies involved in providing gender-affirming care to minors, including addressing deception, fraud, and violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to long-term side effects. The Attorney General has issued memoranda outlining how the DOJ will implement the EO.
*   **Policy Rescission**: Agencies are mandated to rescind or amend all policies that rely on the "Standards of Care Version 8" developed by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), with the assertion that these standards were not based on scientific evidence but on political considerations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) removed prior guidance promoting "Gender-affirming Care and Young People" from its webpages, although a court order later compelled its temporary display with a disclaimer disavowing its content.
*   **Whistleblower Protection**: HHS, in consultation with the Attorney General, issued guidance in April 2025 to protect whistleblowers who report concerns about "chemical or surgical mutilation of children," clarifying that HIPAA does not prohibit such disclosures under specific conditions and outlining anti-retaliation protections.
*   **Legislative Initiatives**: In September 2025, the DOJ transmitted a legislative proposal to Congress, the "Victims of Chemical or Surgical Mutilation Act (VCSMA)," which aims to prohibit healthcare professionals from performing these interventions on children and create a private right of action for children and their parents who claim harm from such procedures.

### 3. Background on Gender Dysphoria and Gender-Affirming Care for Minors

Gender dysphoria is a medical condition characterized by significant distress arising from a incongruence between an individual's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Over the last decade, there has been a notable increase in gender identity-related diagnoses among youth, particularly adolescent females. For instance, from 2017 to 2021, approximately 121,882 children aged 6 to 17 in the U.S. were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, with 42,000 diagnoses occurring in 2021 alone, nearly tripling the 2017 figure. A 2023 national survey (YRBS) estimates that 3.3%, or 724,000 youth aged 13 to 17, identify as transgender in the U.S..

Gender-affirming care (GAC) is a comprehensive approach that may include medical, surgical, mental health, and non-medical services to support transgender and nonbinary individuals in aligning their outward physical traits with their gender identity. For transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents, early GAC is considered crucial for overall health and well-being, potentially increasing confidence and allowing focus on social transitions.

The specific medical interventions covered by the EO include:
*   **Puberty Blockers (GnRH agonists)**: These medications delay the onset or progression of puberty. They have been safely used since 1993 for treating precocious puberty. Between 2017 and 2021, about 4,780 adolescents began puberty blockers in the U.S..
*   **Cross-sex Hormones**: These hormones (e.g., estrogen or testosterone) induce the development of secondary sex characteristics aligning with a person's gender identity. Approximately 14,726 adolescents started hormone treatments between 2017 and 2021.
*   **Gender-Affirming Surgeries**: These procedures attempt to transform physical appearance or alter sexual organs. Studies indicate that gender-affirming surgeries are rarely performed on minors. A 2019 study utilizing medical insurance claims data found little to no utilization of gender-affirming surgeries by transgender and gender-diverse minors in the U.S., noting that cisgender minors and adults had significantly higher utilization of analogous surgeries. Between 2019 and 2021, at least 56 genital surgeries and 776 mastectomies were performed on adolescents aged 13 to 17 with a gender dysphoria diagnosis.

### 4. Differing Perspectives and Evidence

The issuance of EO 14187 highlights a deep division in medical, ethical, and legal interpretations regarding gender-affirming care for minors.

#### 4.1. Arguments Supporting Restrictions (Proponents of EO 14187)

*   **Irreversibility and Regret**: The EO and its proponents express concerns that medical interventions like puberty blockers, hormones, and surgeries are "irreversible" and lead to "lifelong medical complications" and "sterilization," with "countless children soon regret[ting] that they have been mutilated".
*   **Lack of Scientific Rigor**: Proponents argue that gender-affirming care is based on "ideologically driven and financially motivated junk-science" and that WPATH's Standards of Care Version 8 were "not drafted based on scientific evidence". A November 2025 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) claimed that GAC for individuals under 18 in the U.S. "falls short of the standards expected for medical treatment" and criticized U.S. doctors for "unyielding support" for GAC whose diagnosis "centers on attitudes, feelings, and behaviors that are known to fluctuate during adolescence".
*   **Desistance Rates**: The concept of "desistance," where childhood gender dysphoria resolves naturally before or during puberty, is a key argument. Historically, studies have suggested that on average 80% of children with gender dysphoria may "desist" and no longer identify as transgender by adulthood. Some analyses indicate that only 2.5% to 20% of childhood Gender Identity Disorder cases are initial manifestations of irreversible transsexualism. A July 2024 German study found that for most young people, a gender identity-related diagnosis (F64) does not persist after 5 years, with only 36.4% retaining the diagnosis, and adolescent females (15-19) showing the lowest persistence rate (27.3%).
*   **Comorbidity**: Over 70% of young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria also have at least one other psychiatric diagnosis, including depressive disorders (67% of males, 76% of females), anxiety disorders, borderline personality disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorders. This raises questions about whether underlying mental health issues should be addressed prior to or in conjunction with gender-affirming medical interventions.
*   **Whistleblower Encouragement**: The administration has actively encouraged whistleblowers to report instances of "chemical and surgical mutilation of children," providing guidance on HIPAA compliance and anti-retaliation protections.

#### 4.2. Counterarguments and Medical Consensus (Opponents of EO 14187)

*   **Medical Necessity and Efficacy**: Major U.S. medical associations, including the American Medical Association (AMA), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Endocrine Society, endorse gender-affirming care as "safe, effective, and medically necessary" for transgender youth. They contend that the claims made by the EO are "rooted in politics and partisanship" and "misrepresent the consensus of medical science".
*   **Improved Mental Health Outcomes**: Research indicates that gender-affirming care significantly improves the mental health and overall well-being of gender-diverse children and adolescents. Studies have shown it alleviates symptoms of depression, anxiety, suicidality, and self-harm. For example, socially transitioned prepubescent transgender youth experienced rates of depression and anxiety comparable to their cisgender siblings.
*   **Critiques of "Desistance" Studies**: Critics argue that the commonly cited "80% desistance rate" is based on poor methodological quality, an evolving understanding of gender (potentially misclassifying nonbinary individuals), and studies that may have attempted to dissuade youth from identifying as transgender. Furthermore, the concept of "desistance" is poorly defined in literature, leading some to suggest its use should be discontinued in clinical work and research to instead focus on reducing distress.
*   **"Mutilation" Terminology**: Opponents of the EO argue that its use of terms like "chemical and surgical mutilation" is "harmful and inaccurate," serving to mischaracterize medically accepted care. They point out that puberty blockers, for example, have a long history of safe use for other conditions.
*   **Ethical and Legal Concerns**: Legal challenges argue the EO "exceed[s] presidential authority, infringe[s] on the powers of Congress, and facially discriminate[s] on the basis of transgender status and sex," violating constitutional principles. Additionally, the HHS report criticizing GAC was noted to have reviewers with financial interests or strong anti-GAC stances, raising concerns about potential bias.

### 5. Impact and Implications

The implementation of Executive Order 14187, despite ongoing legal challenges, has significant implications across medical, legal, and social spheres.

#### 5.1. Legal Challenges and Enforceability

The EO faces considerable legal hurdles. Multiple lawsuits have been filed by groups like PFLAG, Inc., and attorneys general from 15 states, asserting the order is discriminatory and unconstitutional. Federal judges have issued temporary restraining orders and injunctions, blocking the federal government from conditioning or withholding funds from healthcare entities that provide gender-affirming care to minors. These injunctions have led some hospitals that initially halted care for minors to resume it. The ultimate constitutionality of such bans at both federal and state levels is likely to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, as seen in *United States v. Skrmetti*, where a June 2025 ruling upheld Tennessee's state ban against claims of sex-based discrimination under the 14th Amendment, leaving 25 state bans in effect. However, state-level injunctions based on other grounds, such as state constitutional law or due process, may still stand.

#### 5.2. Medical Practice and Patient Access

The EO aims to significantly limit the ability of healthcare providers to furnish GAC to individuals under 19. While some hospitals paused care initially, legal injunctions allowed others to continue. However, the broader chilling effect of the EO and similar state laws is evident, with some providers halting care out of fear of legal repercussions. The DOJ's proposed "Victims of Chemical or Surgical Mutilation Act (VCSMA)" further threatens healthcare professionals with prohibitions on providing care and the creation of private rights of action for alleged harm.

#### 5.3. Societal and Political Landscape

The EO intensifies the politicization of gender-affirming care and transgender rights. It contributes to a nationwide climate of fear and anti-trans hostility, particularly when combined with other executive orders issued in early 2025 targeting transgender people. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicates a rising trend in gender identity-based hate crimes, increasing from 307 offenses in 2021 to 547 in 2023. The conflict underscores a fundamental disagreement on parental rights versus state intervention in medical decisions for minors, and the role of the federal government in healthcare.

### 6. Limitations and Uncertainties

Despite the extensive debate, several areas of limitation and uncertainty exist:
*   **Long-term Outcomes Data**: There is an acknowledged paucity of high-quality, long-term data on the outcomes of gender-affirming medical interventions for adolescents, particularly concerning the stability of gender identity and the long-term physical and psychological effects. A 2025 NIH-funded study found no changes in mental health of youth treated with puberty blockers over 24 months, with critics highlighting the lack of a valid comparison group.
*   **Definition of Desistance**: The concept and accurate measurement of "desistance" in gender dysphoria remain contentious, with critiques of older studies' methodologies and definitions. The impact of social affirmation on desistance rates is also an area requiring further rigorous study.
*   **Comorbidity Treatment Pathways**: While high rates of mental health comorbidities are noted among youth with gender dysphoria, the optimal treatment pathways and sequencing of interventions (addressing mental health vs. gender dysphoria) are subjects of ongoing clinical discussion and research.
*   **Legal Landscape Evolution**: The legal landscape surrounding gender-affirming care for minors is highly fluid. The ultimate outcome of federal and state lawsuits, including potential Supreme Court rulings, will significantly shape the enforceability and impact of EO 14187 and similar policies.
*   **Bias in Research and Reporting**: As highlighted by criticisms of the November 2025 HHS report, potential biases exist in both the production and interpretation of research and policy recommendations regarding gender-affirming care.

### 7. Conclusions

Executive Order 14187 represents a significant federal directive aimed at restricting gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 years old in the United States. Its core policy is to prohibit federal funding and support for puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and related surgeries, characterizing them as "chemical and surgical mutilation". This policy is supported by concerns about the irreversibility of procedures, potential regret, long-term health complications, and claims of insufficient scientific evidence.

However, the EO faces substantial opposition and legal challenges. Major U.S. medical organizations maintain that gender-affirming care is medically necessary and improves mental health outcomes for transgender youth, rejecting the administration's characterization of these treatments. Federal court injunctions have temporarily blocked key enforcement mechanisms of the EO, creating a complex and uncertain regulatory environment for healthcare providers. The Department of Justice's pursuit of legislative bans and encouragement of whistleblowers signal a continued federal effort to curb such care.

The ongoing legal battles and the divergent scientific and ethical perspectives underscore the need for high-quality, long-term research on the efficacy and outcomes of various approaches to gender dysphoria in minors. Policymakers must carefully consider both the stated concerns about potential harms and the evidence supporting the mental health benefits of gender-affirming care, as well as the constitutional and human rights implications of restricting access to medical treatment.
