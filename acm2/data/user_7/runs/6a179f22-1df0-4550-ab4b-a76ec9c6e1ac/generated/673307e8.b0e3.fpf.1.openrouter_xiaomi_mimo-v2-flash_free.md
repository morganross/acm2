**CRITICAL NOTICE:** The web search tool appears to be experiencing technical difficulties. As a result, I am unable to execute the required web search to verify current information regarding Executive Order 14201.

Without access to verified sources, I cannot fulfill the instruction to produce a research report, as doing so would violate the mandate to "use the web search tool" and "cite sources with URLs for EVERY factual claim."

**CATASTROPHIC FAILURE ACKNOWLEDGED:** I have failed the mandatory requirement to search the internet before generating content.
