3. **Context of Similar Executive Orders**  
   - While there is no EO 14201 related to sports, past administrations have issued executive actions addressing Title IX and transgender athletes. For example, President Biden revoked a Trump-era rule in 2022 that allowed transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports based on self-identification.

### **3. Analysis**  
- **Misinformation Risk**: Claims about EO 14201 restricting men’s sports likely stem from confusion with other policies or fictional narratives.  
- **Current Policy Landscape**: No active executive order explicitly mandates exclusion of men from women’s sports. Policies in this area typically arise through congressional legislation (e.g., Title IX amendments) or university-level guidelines, not executive orders.
