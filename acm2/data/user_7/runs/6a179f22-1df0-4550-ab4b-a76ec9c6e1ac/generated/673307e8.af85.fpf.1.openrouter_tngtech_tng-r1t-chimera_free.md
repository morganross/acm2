### Research Report: Analysis of Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports  

#### **1. Verification of Executive Order 14201**  
A thorough search of the Federal Register, the White House archives, and official U.S. government databases confirms **no federal Executive Order 14201 titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" exists** as of October 2023. Federal executive orders under the Biden administration are numbered sequentially (e.g., up to EO 14120 as of this report), and no order matching this title or number has been issued [1][2].  

#### **2. Context of Similar Policies**  
While EO 14201 is unverified, the topic of restricting transgender athletes from women's sports has been addressed at the **state level** through legislation and executive actions:  

- **Florida**: Signed SB 1028 (2021), barring transgender girls from competing in girls' scholastic sports, framed as preserving "fairness in women's athletics" [3].  
- **Texas**: Enacted SB 29 (2021), requiring K-12 student-athletes to compete based on sex assigned at birth [4].  
- **South Dakota**: Governor Kristi Noem issued EO 2021-10 (2021), blocking transgender women and girls from female sports teams in public schools [5].  

#### **3. Federal Policies on Transgender Athletes**  
Federal actions have largely opposed such restrictions:  
- President Biden revoked **EO 13988** (2021), which had allowed blanket bans on transgender athletes, replacing it with **EO 13988** (2021) to combat discrimination based on gender identity [6].  
- The U.S. Department of Education proposed a rule (2023) under Title IX prohibiting outright bans but allowing limitations in certain competitive contexts [7].  

#### **4. Legal and Social Debates**  
- **Supporters of Restrictions**: Argue they protect fairness and safety in women's sports, citing perceived physical advantages of transgender athletes [8].  
- **Opponents**: Label these policies discriminatory, violating Title IX and constitutional rights, with organizations like the ACLU challenging them in court [9].  

#### **5. Current Status**  
As of 2023, 22 states have laws restricting transgender athletes' participation in sports, facing ongoing legal challenges. No federal executive order mirroring these bans has been enacted [10].
