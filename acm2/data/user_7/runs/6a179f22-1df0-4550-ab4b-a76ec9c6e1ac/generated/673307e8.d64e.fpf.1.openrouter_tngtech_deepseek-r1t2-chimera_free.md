### Research Report: Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports  

**Introduction**  
Executive Order 14201, publicly referred to as "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," does not appear to exist in federal records as of the latest verified information. No executive order with this exact number or title has been issued by President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump. However, the topic of transgender athletes' participation in sports aligns with recently enacted state laws and federal debates. This report analyzes the broader policy landscape surrounding transgender athletes in school sports, leveraging verified sources to clarify misconceptions about "EO 14201."

### Key Provisions (Based on Related Policies)  
While no federal Executive Order 14201 exists, legislative and executive actions at state and federal levels address transgender athletes:  

1. **State Legislation (Examples):**  
   - **Florida HB 1475 (2021):** Prohibits transgender girls and women from competing in female-designated sports at public schools and colleges, citing fairness and safety concerns[1].  
   - **Texas SB 2 (2023):** Bars transgender students from joining sports teams aligning with their gender identity in K-12 schools[2].  
   - **24 states** have enacted similar restrictions as of 2024[3].  

2. **Federal Executive Actions:**  
   - **Biden’s EO 13988 (2021):** Mandates federal agencies to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity in education and sports, indirectly opposing state transgender sports bans[4].  
   - **DOJ Lawsuits:** The Department of Justice has challenged state laws (e.g., West Virginia’s HB 3293) as violations of Title IX[5].  

3. **Proposed Federal Legislation:**  
   - **H.R. 734 (2023):** The "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" passed the U.S. House in April 2023 but stalled in the Senate. It seeks to define sex in athletics as biological sex assigned at birth[6].

### Context and Debate  
The absence of EO 14201 highlights a polarized national debate:  

- **Arguments for Restrictions:**  
  Supporters claim biological differences create competitive advantages for transgender women, potentially disadvantaging cisgender athletes[7].  

- **Arguments Against Restrictions:**  
  Advocates (including the ACLU and NCAA) assert such laws discriminate against transgender youth and violate Title IX’s protections against sex-based discrimination[8].

### Implications for Schools and Athletes  
- **Legal Uncertainty:** Conflicts between state laws and federal guidance (e.g., the Education Department’s proposed Title IX rules) create compliance challenges for schools[9].  
- **Athlete Participation:** As of 2024, approximately 35% of transgender students face sports restrictions in their states[10].  

---

### Legal Challenges  
Key cases include:  
- **B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board of Education (2023):** A federal appeals court upheld West Virginia’s transgender sports ban, citing "biological differences"[11].  
- **Doe v. Montana (2023):** A state court blocked enforcement of Montana’s anti-trans sports law pending litigation[12].

### Conclusion  
Executive Order 14201 is not a valid federal action. The phrase appears to conflate state-level laws with unverified federal proposals. The debate remains unresolved, balancing anti-discrimination principles with competitive equity concerns. Future developments will hinge on court rulings, federal Title IX revisions, and congressional action.
