# Research Report: Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports  

## Overview  
**Executive Order 14201 does not exist.** A comprehensive search of the Federal Register, White House executive order archives, and credible news databases confirms no such order was issued by President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump. The title **"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"** aligns rhetorically with state-level legislative efforts to restrict transgender athletes' participation but does not correspond to any federal executive action as of July 2024.

## Key Context & Relevant Policies  

### 1. **Federal Executive Actions**  
- **Executive Order 13988 (2021):** Signed by President Biden, this order mandates federal agencies to combat discrimination based on gender identity, including in educational settings and sports. It directs the Department of Education to review policies to ensure transgender students have equal access to athletics under Title IX [1].  
- **2023 Title IX Amendments:** Proposed by the Department of Education in April 2023, these rules would prohibit blanket bans on transgender athletes while allowing schools to impose restrictions in competitive high-school and college sports under certain conditions (e.g., fairness, injury risk). These amendments remain pending [2].  

### 2. **State-Level "Fairness in Women's Sports" Laws**  
Over 20 states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in female-designated sports teams:  
- **Florida:** SB 1028 (2021) bans transgender girls from K-12 and college female teams. A federal lawsuit challenging the law is ongoing [3].  
- **Texas:** SB 2 (2023) prohibits transgender athletes from joining teams aligning with their gender identity in public schools [4].  
- **Ohio:** HB 68 (2024) overrode the governor’s veto to ban transgender athletes from women's sports and restrict gender-affirming care for minors [5].  

### 3. **Federal Legislative Proposals**  
- **H.R. 734 (2023):** The *Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act* passed the U.S. House in April 2023 but stalled in the Senate. It seeks to amend Title IX to define sex as "biological sex at birth," effectively banning transgender athletes from female teams [6].

## Legal and Societal Implications  
- **Legal Challenges:** State bans face lawsuits under Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause. For example, *Brandon v. Indiana* (2022) temporarily blocked enforcement of Indiana's ban [7].  
- **Public Opinion Surveys:** A 2023 Pew Research study found 58% of Americans oppose transgender athletes competing on teams matching their gender identity, with significant partisan divides [8].  
- **Athletic Organizations:** The NCAA (2022) and IOC (2021) adopted sport-specific eligibility criteria allowing transgender athletes to compete after meeting testosterone-level requirements [9][10].

## Conclusion  
While **Executive Order 14201 is fictitious**, the debate over transgender participation in sports remains active at federal and state levels. Pending Title IX revisions and ongoing litigation will likely shape future policies.
