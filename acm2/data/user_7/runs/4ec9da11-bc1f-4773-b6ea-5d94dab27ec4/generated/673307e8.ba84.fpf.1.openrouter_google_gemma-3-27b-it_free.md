Okay, I understand. I will analyze Executive Order 14201—"Improving the Nation’s Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Capabilities" (often referred to as the "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" order, though that is not its official name) using web search and providing a detailed report with citations.

First, I will use the web search tool to gather information about the order, its purpose, and the controversy surrounding it.

```tool_code
