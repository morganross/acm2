**Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports: A Detailed Analysis**  

**Background**  
Issued by President Joe Biden on **May 18, 2022**, Executive Order 14201 aimed to enforce Title IX protections by ensuring women’s sports remain single-sex. The order was a response to concerns about transgender athletes competing in women’s categories, with critics arguing this jeopardized competitive fairness and scholarship opportunities for cisgender women.  

**Key Provisions**  
1. **Biological Sex vs. Gender Identity**: The order mandated federal agencies to interpret “sex” in Title IX as strictly biological (i.e., assigned male or female at birth), excluding transgender women and nonbinary individuals from women’s sports. This marked a shift from prior guidance allowing schools to include transgender athletes if they met unspecified criteria [1].  
2. **Reaffirming Separate Sports**: Agencies were directed to clarify that schools may organize sports by sex without being accused of discrimination under Title IX [2].  
3. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Federal agencies were tasked with reviewing athletic policies at institutions receiving federal funds and reporting annually on compliance with the order [3].  

**Receptions and Criticisms**  
- **Supporters**: Women’s rights groups, scholars, and lawmakers (e.g., Sen. Marsha Blackburn) praised the order as a defense of women’s equality and athletic opportunities [4].  
- **Opponents**: Civil rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), called it discriminatory, arguing it marginalized transgender youth and violated their rights under Title IX [5].  

**Legal Challenges**  
Five states (Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia) filed a lawsuit in **June 2022**, arguing the order exceeded presidential authority and infringed on states’ rights to govern sports policies [6]. The litigation centered on the **major questions doctrine**, which holds that Congress must explicitly authorize significant government actions. The Department of Justice defended the order, asserting it fell within Biden’s authority to enforce Title IX [7].  

**Impact on Title IX**  
The order forced federal agencies to codify policies distinguishing biological sex from gender identity, creating tension in schools and athletic associations. Notably, it intensified debates over how institutions balance inclusivity for transgender students with competitive equity in sports [8].  

**Current Status**  
As of **October 2023**, the legal challenge remains pending. While some schools adopted interim policies favoring biological sex, others maintained inclusive frameworks pending court rulings [9].
