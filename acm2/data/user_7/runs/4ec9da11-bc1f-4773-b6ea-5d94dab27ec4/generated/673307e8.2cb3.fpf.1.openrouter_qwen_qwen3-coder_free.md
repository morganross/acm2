## Overview

Executive Order 14201, titled "Ensuring Fair Competition in Women's Sports," was signed by President Joe Biden on January 4, 2024 [1]. The order addresses policies related to participation in women's athletic competitions, particularly focusing on transgender athletes in educational settings that receive federal funding [2].

## Key Provisions

The executive order establishes a framework for federal agencies to develop policies ensuring fair competition in women's sports while complying with applicable federal laws, including Title IX [4]. The order specifically:

1. **Directs Federal Agencies**: Requires the Department of Education, Department of Defense, and other relevant agencies to review and update their policies regarding athletic participation to ensure fair competition in women's sports [4].

2. **Title IX Compliance**: Emphasizes that policies must be consistent with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and its implementing regulations [4].

3. **Evidence-Based Approach**: Mandates that federal agencies rely on the best available scientific evidence, including biological factors, when developing policies related to athletic eligibility [4].

4. **Applicability**: Applies to educational institutions, including schools and universities, that receive federal financial assistance [2].

## Implementation

The Department of Education is primarily responsible for implementing this executive order within the educational context [5]. The order directs agencies to propose revisions to existing regulations within 240 days of the order's issuance and to finalize rules as expeditiously as possible [4].

The order acknowledges existing variation in state laws regarding transgender athlete participation and seeks to establish consistent federal guidelines for institutions under federal jurisdiction [4]. It emphasizes that policies should be based on scientific evidence regarding biological differences that may affect athletic performance [4].

## Reactions and Context
