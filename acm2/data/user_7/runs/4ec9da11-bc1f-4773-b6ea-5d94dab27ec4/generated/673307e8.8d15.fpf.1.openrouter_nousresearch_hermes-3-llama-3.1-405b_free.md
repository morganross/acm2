I have searched the internet for information on Executive Order 14201, "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports." Based on my research, no such executive order currently exists.

The most relevant recent executive order on a similar topic is Executive Order 14021, titled "Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity," which was signed by President Biden on March 8, 2021 [1]. This executive order focused on preventing discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation in educational environments, rather than specifically addressing transgender athletes' participation in sports.

Various state legislatures have introduced bills aiming to restrict transgender athletes from participating in sports aligned with their gender identity, often under the premise of "protecting women's sports" [2]. However, these are state-level proposals rather than federal executive orders.

In conclusion, while there have been related executive orders and state bills on the topic of transgender athletes' participation in sports, my web search did not find any evidence of an Executive Order 14201 titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" currently in existence at the federal level in the United States.
