**Research Report: Analysis of Executive Order 14201 – "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"**  

### **1. Validity of Executive Order 14201**  
As of the latest verified information, **no federal Executive Order numbered 14201 titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" exists**. Executive Orders are publicly accessible via the Federal Register and the White House archives, but no such order has been issued by President Biden or previous administrations[1][2].  

### **2. Context of Federal Policies on Transgender Athletes**  
The Biden administration has primarily focused on **protecting LGBTQ+ rights**, including transgender participation in sports. For example:  
- **Executive Order 13988** (January 20, 2021) enforces prohibitions against sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity[3].  
- The Department of Education proposed a rule in April 2023 under Title IX to allow transgender students to participate in sports aligning with their gender identity, with limited exceptions for competitive fairness[4].  

### **3. State-Level Actions**  
While no federal "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" order exists, **over 20 states have enacted laws banning transgender girls and women from female sports teams**. Examples include:  
- **Florida's SB 1028** (2021), which bars transgender females from girls' sports[5].  
- **Texas's SB 29** (2021), restricting K-12 transgender athletes[6].  

### **4. Public and Legal Debates**  
The issue remains contentious:  
- Supporters argue such policies protect fairness in women's sports[7].  
- Opponents, including the ACLU, deem these laws discriminatory and harmful to transgender youth[8].  

### **5. Conclusion**  
Executive Order 14201 does not exist at the federal level. However, state-level legislation aligns with the purported intent of the hypothetical order. Federal efforts under the Biden administration have largely opposed such restrictions.
