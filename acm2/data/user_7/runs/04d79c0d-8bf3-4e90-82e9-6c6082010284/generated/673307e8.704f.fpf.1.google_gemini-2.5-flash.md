## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports – A Research Report

**Executive Order 14201**, titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on February 5, 2025. This executive order aims to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports across all educational levels in the United States. The order is part of a broader set of actions targeting transgender people by the administration.

### Policy and Purpose

The stated policy and purpose of Executive Order 14201 are to "protect opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports". The order asserts that the allowance of "men" to compete in "women's sports" is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls," and that it "denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports". It further claims that such participation violates Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 by depriving women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities.

Consequently, the executive order establishes a U.S. policy to rescind federal funding from educational programs that are deemed to "deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities" by allowing male competitive participation in women's sports. The order also declares a broader U.S. policy to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports "as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth".

### Key Provisions

Executive Order 14201 outlines several directives to achieve its objectives:
*   **Federal Funding Withdrawal:** It mandates the rescission of federal funds from elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions that permit transgender girls to play on girls' teams.
*   **Title IX Enforcement:** The Secretary of Education is directed to take all appropriate actions, including Title IX enforcement actions, against educational institutions (including athletic associations) that deny female students equal opportunity in sports by requiring them to compete with or against or appear unclothed before males in the women's category.
*   **Protection of Facilities:** The order also directs the Secretary of Education to "protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms".
*   **State Attorneys General Convening:** It calls for convening State Attorneys General to identify best practices for defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women in sports and to educate them about alleged harms caused by male participation in women's sports.
*   **International Policy:** The Secretary of State is directed to use all available measures to advocate for amendments to the International Olympic Committee's standards to ensure that eligibility for participation in women's sporting events is determined by sex, not gender identity or testosterone reduction. The State Department also announced a ban on transgender athletes from entering the U.S. if they attempt to compete in women's sports, with visa applicants listing a gender other than their assigned sex facing a permanent ban for "fraud".

### Definitions

The executive order explicitly states that the definitions established in Executive Order 14168 of January 20, 2025, titled "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government," shall apply to this order. Executive Order 14168 defined "sex" in the federal government's view as a male-female binary, with "female" and "male" defined by a person's reproductive cells at conception.

### Reactions and Outcomes

Following the issuance of Executive Order 14201, the Department of Education urged high school and college athletics organizations like the NCAA and NFHS to revoke transgender female athletes' records and restore those of cisgender athletes. Candice Jackson, a figure associated with the administration, explained that this action was intended to "restore athletic records to women who have for years been devalued, ignored and forced to watch men steal their accolades".

The NCAA revised its participation policy for transgender student-athletes, with its president, Charlie Baker, stating that the NCAA would comply with the executive order and praising it for providing "a clear, national standard". Effective February 6, 2025, the NCAA changed its policy to limit college competitions in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

### Legal Challenges

At least one legal challenge has emerged in response to the executive order. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 discriminate against transgender individuals in violation of the Constitution and Title IX. These challenges are expected to reference the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, which concluded that discrimination based on gender identity is inherently a form of sex-based discrimination under Title VII.

### Related Legislation

In January 2025, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" of 2025. This measure seeks to amend Title IX to define sex solely based on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth, restricting transgender students from playing on women's sports teams.
