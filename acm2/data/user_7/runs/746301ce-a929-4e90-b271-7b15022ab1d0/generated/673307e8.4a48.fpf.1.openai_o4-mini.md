**Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports: Research Report**

**Introduction**  
Executive Order 14201, titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” was signed by President Donald J. Trump on February 5, 2025, and published in the Federal Register on February 11, 2025. It directs federal agencies to withdraw funding from any educational program that permits individuals assigned male at birth to compete in girls’ or women’s sports, invoking Title IX’s prohibition on sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs [1][2].

**Background and Purpose**  
Section 1 of the Order asserts that allowing “men” to compete in women’s sports undermines fairness, safety, privacy, and equal opportunity for female athletes. It cites recent federal court decisions—Tennessee v. Cardona and Kansas v. U.S. Department of Education—as recognizing that “ignoring fundamental biological truths between the two sexes deprives women and girls of meaningful access to educational facilities” under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 [1][2].  

**Definitions**  
Section 2 incorporates definitions from Executive Order 14168 (“Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”), which define “male” and “female” based on sex assigned at birth, excluding gender identity considerations [1].  

**Key Provisions**  
- **Section 3 (Education):**  
  - The Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Attorney General, must ensure the April 29, 2024, Title IX nondiscrimination rule (89 FR 33474) remains vacated, reaffirm “all-female” athletic opportunities and privacy, and prioritize enforcement against institutions requiring women to compete against or appear in the presence of males [1].  
  - All executive departments must review grants to educational programs and rescind funding from non-compliant entities [1].  
  - The Department of Justice shall allocate necessary resources for expeditious enforcement [1].  

- **Section 4 (Fairness, Safety, and International Advocacy):**  
  - The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy must convene, within 60 days, athletic organizations, female athletes harmed by existing policies, and State Attorneys General to develop sex-based eligibility best practices [1].  
  - The Secretary of State must rescind support for international exchanges that base women’s categories on gender identity, promote sex-based sports categories at the United Nations, and work with international bodies to amend eligibility rules to require participation based on sex assigned at birth [1].  
  - The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall review visa and admission policies to prevent male-born athletes from entering the U.S. for women’s sports, utilizing existing immigration law authorities [1].  

**Implementation and Enforcement**  
Following the Order:  
- The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) adopted a policy barring transgender women from women’s Olympic sports, mandating that national federations revise rules or risk loss of chartered status, aligning with the February 2025 executive directive [3][4].  
- The NCAA announced compliance and immediately restricted women’s college sports to athletes assigned female at birth, citing the need for a clear national standard [2].  
- Some state entities, such as the California Interscholastic Federation, publicly stated they would continue to follow state law permitting transgender participation, risking federal funding under the Order [2].  

**Reactions and Stakeholder Responses**  
- NCAA President Charlie Baker praised the Order for establishing a uniform standard across conflicting state laws and court rulings [2].  
- A New York Times/Ipsos poll in January 2025 found that 79% of Americans supported restricting transgender athletes from women’s sports; a 2023 Gallup poll reported 69% favored participation aligned with sex assigned at birth [2].  
- In response to the Order, Republican lawmakers in the House passed the “Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025,” amending Title IX to define sex biologically; the Senate later blocked it in a 51–45 party-line vote [2].  

**Legal Challenges and Litigation**  
- In *State of Tennessee v. Cardona*, the Eastern District of Kentucky vacated the DOE’s 2024 Title IX gender-identity regulation, finding it beyond the agency’s authority under the Administrative Procedure Act and inconsistent with Title IX’s text [5].  
- The Department of Justice sued the California Dept. of Education and the California Interscholastic Federation for allowing transgender girls to compete on girls’ teams, alleging Title IX violations and threatening funding withdrawal; California defended its longstanding inclusive policy [6].  
- On May 2, 2025, the USDA settled a funding dispute with Maine after withholding funds over the state’s transgender athlete policy, restoring nutrition program funding without resolving the underlying Title IX question [7].  
- *West Virginia v. B. P. J.*, argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on January 13, 2026, addresses whether Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause allows states to restrict participation to those designated female at birth; a Fourth Circuit decision had previously found West Virginia’s ban unconstitutional [8].  

**Outcomes and Policy Extensions**  
- The Department of Education urged high school and college athletics bodies to annul transgender women’s records and reinstate records of cisgender athletes, framing this as restoration of fairness under Title IX [2].  
- On February 25, 2025, the State Department announced a visa ban on transgender women athletes attempting to enter the U.S. for competition, marking applications with a special code and permanently barring applicants listing a gender different from sex assigned at birth [2].  

**Historical Context**  
Title IX, enacted in 1972, prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs, including athletics, and has historically been interpreted to require equal athletic opportunities for male and female students [13]. In May 2016, the Obama Administration issued non-binding guidance directing schools to allow transgender students to use facilities and participate in sports consistent with gender identity, warning that noncompliance risked loss of federal funding [14].  

**Impact Analysis**  
- **Female Athletes:** May perceive increased fairness and dedicated opportunities, but face potential backlash and divisive policy environments.  
- **Transgender Students and Families:** Face exclusion from sports aligning with gender identity, with emotional and social consequences.  
- **Educational Institutions:** Must navigate federal compliance or risk funding loss, potentially resulting in legal fees, policy revisions, and community disputes.  
- **State Governments and Courts:** Continue to litigate over Title IX interpretation, with outcomes affecting broader civil rights and administrative law precedents.  

**Conclusion**  
Executive Order 14201 represents a significant federal intervention in the regulation of sex-segregated sports, leveraging Title IX’s funding provisions to enforce a biological-sex standard and excluding transgender women from women’s sports. Its implementation has prompted swift changes by national sports bodies, sparked extensive litigation, and highlighted deep societal divisions over gender identity, fairness, and the scope of federal authority.
