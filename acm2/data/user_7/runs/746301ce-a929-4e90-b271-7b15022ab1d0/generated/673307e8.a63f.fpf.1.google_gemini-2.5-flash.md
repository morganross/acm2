## Executive Order 14201: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports – A Detailed Research Report

**Washington D.C.** – On February 5, 2025, former President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14201, officially titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports," with the stated aim of safeguarding opportunities for women and girls in competitive sports. The executive order seeks to prohibit transgender women and girls from participating in female sports across all educational levels, asserting that such participation is "demeaning, unfair, and dangerous" to cisgender female athletes.

### Policy and Purpose

The core objective of Executive Order 14201 is to establish a federal policy that reserves women's sports for individuals assigned female at birth. The order explicitly states that allowing "men" (as defined by the administration's interpretation of sex) to compete in women's sports denies women and girls equal opportunities to participate and excel, potentially endangering and humiliating them, and depriving them of privacy. It further declares that the United States will oppose male competitive participation in women's sports more broadly, citing concerns for safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.

### Definitional Framework

Executive Order 14201 relies on the definitions set forth in a preceding order, Executive Order 14168, issued on January 20, 2025, titled "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government". Executive Order 14168 defines "sex" as an individual's "immutable biological classification as either male or female" determined at conception, explicitly stating that "sex" is not synonymous with "gender identity". These definitions are central to the implementation and enforcement of Executive Order 14201.

### Key Provisions and Directives

The executive order outlines several directives for federal agencies and educational institutions:

*   **Federal Funding Rescission:** It mandates the rescission of federal funding from educational programs that permit transgender girls to participate on girls' sports teams, deeming such actions a violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972.
*   **Department of Education Actions:** The U.S. Secretary of Education is directed to take appropriate measures to "affirmatively protect all-female athletic opportunities and all-female locker rooms". This includes prioritizing Title IX enforcement actions against institutions that require female students to compete against or appear unclothed before males.
*   **Inter-Agency Review:** All federal executive departments and agencies are instructed to review grants to educational programs and rescind funding for those that fail to comply with the executive order's policy.
*   **International Engagement:** The order also calls for convening State Attorneys General to identify best practices in defining and enforcing equal opportunities for women in sports and for promoting consistent standards at international bodies like the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee.
*   **Immigration Restrictions:** Additionally, the State Department announced a ban on transgender athletes entering the United States if they intend to compete in women's sports, marking the visa files of suspected individuals with 'SWS25'. Visa applicants who list a gender other than their assigned sex on their application face a permanent ban from entering the U.S. on grounds of "fraud".

### Impact and Reactions

Executive Order 14201 has elicited significant reactions and led to immediate changes and legal challenges:

*   **NCAA Compliance:** The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) declared its compliance with the executive order, subsequently changing its policy to restrict college competitions in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth, effective immediately.
*   **Department of Education Guidance:** The Department of Education urged high school and college athletics organizations to revoke the records of female transgender athletes and reinstate those of cisgender athletes.
*   **Legislative Action:** In January 2025, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the "Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act" of 2025, which aims to amend Title IX by defining sex solely based on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth, aligning with the executive order's stance.
*   **Legal Challenges:** The executive order has faced legal opposition. On February 12, 2025, two transgender high school students in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that Executive Orders 14168 and 14201 are discriminatory and violate both the Constitution and Title IX.
*   **Supreme Court Involvement:** The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments concerning state bans on transgender female students participating in women's and girls' scholastic sports, grappling with concepts of "fairness" and "equal opportunity". This ongoing legal and societal debate underscores the complex nature and far-reaching implications of Executive Order 14201.
