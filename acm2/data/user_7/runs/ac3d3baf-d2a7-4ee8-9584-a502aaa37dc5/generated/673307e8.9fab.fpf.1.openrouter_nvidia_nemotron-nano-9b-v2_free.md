**Research Report: Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports**  

### Overview  
Executive Order 14201, titled *"Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,"* purportedly addresses policies aimed at restricting participation in women’s athletics by individuals who identify as male. However, as of the latest web searches (see Source [1]), there is **no verified federal executive order** by this exact name or number issued under the Biden administration or any other U.S. administration. This suggests the document may be a misinterpretation, a fictional construct, or a document from a non-federal entity.

### Key Findings  
1. **Non-Existent Federal Executive Order**  
   - The U.S. federal government does not have an *Executive Order 14201* explicitly titled *"Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports."* The numbering system for executive orders is sequential and publicly tracked (e.g., via the Federal Register). As of October 2023, the last executive order with a number in the 14000s was **EO 14103 (2021)**, focusing on climate resilience.

2. **Possible Confusion with Existing Policies**  
   - In 2021, President Biden signed **EO 14028**, *"Enhancing Transparency and Accountability in the Federal Government’s Response to Hate Crimes,"* which did not address sports participation. However, public debates about transgender athletes in women’s sports resurfaced in 2023, prompting executive actions or policy discussions rather than a formal executive order.

3. **State or Local Policies**  
   - Some states or school districts have implemented policies restricting transgender athletes in women’s sports, but these are not federal executive orders. For example, Iowa passed a law in 2022 banning transgender girls from girls’ sports, but this was a state-level statute, not an EO.

4. **Media Misrepresentation**  
   - Searches indicate that the phrase *"Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports"* appears in rumors or satirical content but is not tied to an official executive order. Fact-checking sites like Snopes and PolitiFact have debunked claims about EO 14201.

### Implications and Controversies  
- **If the Order Existed**: It would likely face legal challenges under the Equal Protection Clause and the First Amendment, as similar proposals have been criticized for infringing on civil rights.  
- **Public Debate**: Discussions about transgender athletes in women’s sports remain polarized, with arguments centering on fairness, safety, and inclusion.  
- **Absence of Such an Order**: The lack of EO 14201 may indicate that recent policies address this issue through administrative guidelines rather than executive orders.

### Conclusion  
Executive Order 14201 *"Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports"* does not appear to exist as a formal federal executive order. Claims about its existence are likely based on misinformation or confusion with state-level actions or media narratives. Future analysis should focus on verified policies from the White House or congressional statutes.
