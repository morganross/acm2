**Research Report: Analysis of Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports**  

### **1. Executive Order 14201: Verification & Context**  
There is **no federal Executive Order 14201 titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports"** issued by the Biden administration or recent predecessors. The number "14201" does not correspond to any existing executive order in the Federal Register or official U.S. government databases as of June 2024 [1]. This title appears to reference state-level legislation or political rhetoric rather than federal action.

### **2. Federal Policy Landscape**  
The Biden administration has taken the **opposite stance** through:  
- **Executive Order 13988 (2021):** Directs federal agencies to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, including under Title IX. This order supports transgender participation in sports aligning with their gender identity [2].  
- **Title IX Updates (2023):** Proposed Department of Education rules would forbid outright bans on transgender athletes in schools but allow restrictions in competitive high school and college sports under certain conditions (e.g., age, level of competition) [3].  

No federal executive order or law currently bans transgender women from women’s sports.

### **3. State-Level Actions**  
Over **25 states** have enacted laws restricting transgender athletes from women’s sports teams, often framed as "Fairness in Women’s Sports Acts":  
- **Tennessee SB 228 (2021):** Requires student athletes to compete based on biological sex at birth [4].  
- **Oklahoma SB 2 (2022):** Signed by Governor Stitt, banning transgender girls from female school sports teams [5].  
- **Florida (2021):** "Fairness in Women’s Sports Act" prohibits transgender females from women’s teams in public schools [6].  

These laws face ongoing legal challenges. For example, West Virginia’s ban was partially blocked by a federal appeals court in 2023 (*Hecox v. Little*) [7].

### **4. Legal & Scholarly Perspectives**  
- **ACLU Position:** Argues such laws violate Title IX and the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause [8].  
- **NCAA Policy:** Allows transgender athletes to compete based on sport-specific guidelines (e.g., testosterone levels for women’s teams) [9].  
- **World Athletics (2023):** Banned transgender women who transitioned after puberty from elite female competitions [10].  

---

### **5. Public Opinion**  
Polls show stark partisan divides:  
- 69% of Republicans support transgender sports bans vs. 19% of Democrats (Pew Research, 2022) [11].  

---

### **Conclusion**  
While "Executive Order 14201" does not exist, the debate reflects state-federal clashes over transgender rights in sports. Federal policy under Biden promotes inclusion, while Republican-led states push restrictions. Legal battles will likely escalate, particularly with the 2024 elections approaching.
