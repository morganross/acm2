The search for "Executive Order 14201—Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" did not yield any verifiable federal executive orders under that title or number. Executive orders are numbered sequentially, and as of 2023, the highest-numbered executive orders under President Joe Biden are in the 14100s (e.g., EO 14115 on May 6, 2024) [1]. No federal "Executive Order 14201" addressing transgender participation in sports exists in official U.S. records. 

However, the topic of restricting transgender athletes from women's sports has been addressed through **state-level legislation** and federal policy debates. Below is an analysis of key developments:

---

### **Federal Actions**
1. **Executive Order 14021 (2021):**  
   Signed by President Biden, this order aimed to *prevent discrimination* based on gender identity in schools and federally funded programs, including athletics. It reversed Trump-era policies that limited transgender participation in sports [2].  

2. **Department of Education Proposed Rule (2023):**  
   The Biden administration proposed a rule allowing schools to restrict transgender athletes in competitive teams but prohibiting blanket bans. Policies must align with Title IX’s anti-discrimination protections [3].

### **State-Level Restrictions**
At least **23 states** have passed laws limiting transgender athletes' participation in women's sports, including:
- **Florida (SB 1028, 2021):** Banned transgender girls from female sports teams in public schools [4].  
- **Texas (SB 29, 2021):** Prohibited transgender students from competing on teams aligning with their gender identity [5].  

These laws face legal challenges, with critics arguing they violate Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause [6].

### **Key Arguments**
- **Supporters of Restrictions:** Argue that transgender women have physical advantages that undermine fairness in women’s sports [7].  
- **Opponents:** Assert that such policies discriminate against transgender athletes and lack scientific consensus on athletic advantage [8].
