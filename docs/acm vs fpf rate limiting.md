how will acm do global rate limiting if fpf is doing the calls?

will acm calculate token useage before sending it to fpf? will fpfp report in realtime to acm? what about gptr? does fpfp have rate limiting and retry and backoff? do we disable that? do we need to update fpf to allow for acm rate limtiting
