### 4. Recent developments concerning Charlie Kirk  

- **Legal motions:** On 18 December 2025, the defense team for Tyler Robinson – the man charged with killing Charlie Kirk – filed a motion to disqualify the Utah County Prosecutor’s Office, alleging a conflict of interest because a prosecutor’s family member was present at the Utah Valley University event where Kirk was shot【3】. A hearing on the motion is slated for mid‑January.  

- **Court proceedings:** The accused made his first in‑person appearance before a Utah judge on 17 December 2025. The judge allowed cameras in the courtroom but issued a publicity order to limit extrajudicial statements from both sides【5】. Robinson faces aggravated murder charges and a possible death‑penalty sentence; he has not yet entered a plea.  

- **Political response:** Turning Point USA, the organization founded by Kirk, held its annual **AmericaFest** conference in Phoenix on 17 December 2025. The event, attended by over 30 000 people, honored Kirk’s legacy and featured prominent conservative figures such as Vice‑President‑candidate JD Vance【4】.  

These items together illustrate that the case remains active in the courts, with procedural disputes and media coverage, while Kirk’s supporters are mobilizing through large‑scale political events.
